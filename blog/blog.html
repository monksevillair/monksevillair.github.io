	   <h2>Let's delete time</h2>
<p>I've decided to run weekly experiments on things like food, sleep, excersise, and whatever else, in order to develop a lifestyle that can significantly increase my productivity and health.<br />
There's also something new about the format, I'm going to implement these posts in the form of the scientific method, which will hopefully make things more relevant when evaluating which change was better and which was worse.<br />
Sometimes, the experiment may take longer than a week, in which case, I'll do a mid week update on the blog post. Just like my Polyphasic blog, I'll have subheadings for the weekly updates in that case.<br />
This week's experiment you ask? <em>Let's delete time.</em> What might it feel like to live in a timeless existence? I've already gone ahead and taped over the clock on my phone, deleted my lockscreen, and removed the clock from my computer, but every once in a while, a new clock unwittingly appears.<br />
So I'm using Saturday, today, as a "time cheat day" to eliminate the extra clocks and set up a calendar for the week with 1hr warnings before I need to make it to my event. This is a compromise, but it will allow me to not blow off everything in my life immediately. Down the road, I may find alternatives to hard scheduling, and perhaps I can set up or write something like Calendy that allows people to schedule time with me and gives me adequate warning.  </p>
<h3>为什么/hypothesis</h3>
<p>I think there could be stress benefits and improvements in prioritizing living in the moment over living for tomorrow. Having a "time cheat day" may force me to simultaneously think about my life from an objective place, and slice my weeks up to support long term goals.  </p>
<h3>Conclusion (11-21-2021)</h3>
<p>This experiment concluded a week ago. Overall some

<h2>Gone Polyphasic</h2>
<h3>11-6-2021</h3>
<p>Keeping these blogs short so I do them more often. After a month long experiment, I dropped my Polyphasic sleep schedule. It ultimately concluded after I flew back to honduras, because it was to hot to sleep in my van during the day. Some unneccessarily detailed notes:</p>

    # 8-10-20
![](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_8_10_2021.svg)
## E3-2
- moved bed to a dark closet
- decided to shift first nap back an hour, last night and the night before at 5 I was debilitatingly tired, couldn't even finish watching a movie
- I think because of the extended schedule I'm not tired for the first nap
- I still wasnt tired even an hour later, didn't really sleep at all.
- let's shift E3-1 to 04:00 and wake at 08:00
  - getting up at 06:00 with the sun is kind of fun, but it's becoming disturbing. I am sleeping the best during E3-1 though
## E3-3
- slept better this time, difficult to make my brain switch off idea mode and go to relax mode
- darkness helps a lot
- ate some Peruvian food/fish soup and beigenets pre sleep
- I think the progressively increasing volume thing on sleep timer will improve life/make me hate the alarm less
- need a pillow
- schedule can totally be tuned to nap when most tired, looking forward to tonight's results
## E3-4
- Not tired, sipped some coffee a few hours ago maybe that's the problem
- didn't sleep a wink
- I hope changing my schedule isn't going to cause sleep dep
- I think I need proper bedding for the naps, needs to be comfy af
# 8-11-2021
## E3-1
- Good sleep but woke up rather tired, overslept 15 mins
- reminds me of every day of highschool. I was so sleep deprived :/
- took ferry and rode bike to shop
  - ferries are awesome
## E3-2
- bad sleep, random building creeks and car sounds kept me up
- bailed on nap a few mins early because someone came by
## E3-3 20:45
- 30 mins late to nap
- Much better sleep, the third one is always good
- put on snowblizzard noise makes it easier to fall asleep eliminates freaky wakeup noises
## E3-4 01:50
- Didn't get any sleep but I feel rested
- shifting back naps was a really good call
- now I feel awake enough that I don't need to sleep
- I believe I'm adapting
- let's try an a true E3 day!
# 8-12-2021
![](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_8_12_2021.svg)
## E2-1 06:30
- at 04:00 bicycled like 2.5 miles from shop to Montgomery st bart in sf, got some bread-based food at Starbucks(bad), barted to 12th street Oakland and another mile to the Oakland apartment
- ate some keto ice cream
- overslept by an hour (5.5hrs of sleep), super groggy till I drank lots of coffee
- this core sleep is problematic, makes me want to try true uberman
- switching to E2, 1 core 06:00-10:30, 2 late naps
  - E3 extended means I'm not really sleepy by the first nap
## E2-3
- great nap, got the eye mask
- it's critical to emulate all your most comfortable sleep parameters
  - for example, I know if I wear a mask and listen to sleep sounds, and have the correct sleep clothing, I will fall asleep quickly. The better you match you sleep params across naps, the better you nap (theory)
- I should go on YouTube and see if other people have had success with uberman. I'm already impressed by everyman, but that core nap really screws everything up.
  - setting up the prius sleep pod may reap great improvements as well, for example, by never having to plan to go to the Oakland apartment, hours can be reclaimed and **life can become one continuous day**
  - justification: yes I want to bike to work, but with uberman I can bring my bike places and bike somewhere beautiful instead
- interesting thought, originally I though the extra hours were making me less stressed (more time to get things done), but actually I think it's constant breaks. I don't really feel stressed about anything and it always feels like I have enough time to calculate my next move
- I've also experienced a few cases where the naps weren't disruptive, but instead I think my friends appreciated it, it gave them time to relax and do their own thing for a few minutes. This was surprising.
## E2-4
- nice nap, but definitely no sleep
  - wasn't tired enough again
  - maybe this nap is too close to previous nap or it's because I overslep on E3-1
- I'm thinking maybe no to uberman right now, it's seems pretty extreme
  - I'm getting very adequate sleep from this current schedule
  - Maybe we'll do 0.5-1hr less core, but let's do a couple days first with this E2 Schedule
# 8-13-2021
![sleep_8_13_2021](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_8_13_2021.svg)
## E2-1
- happy Friday the 13th!
- overslept by an hour
- perhaps I should try true E3 tomorrow (3hr core)
## E2-2
- This day feels long, but effective
- upping the nap lengths to 30mins from 20
- this will give me some buffer to actually fall asleep
- just slept from 21:30-22:00 boy I feel rested!
  - could Buckminster Fuller have something?! (Duh)
  - I'd rather trust him than random internet people
- would be fun to get a brain monitor/make one and monitor the slow wave sleep.
- also do interesting experiments like making the clicking sound at the peaks of slow wave and logging how much slowwave/rem I'm getting
- made some cold brew it's going to be excellent
- mood: 10
## E2-3
- didn't sleep much, too excited about my project, if core goes over target, should really skip one of the naps.
- 30 mins is nice though
- mood: 8.5
# 8-14-2021
## E2-1 05:30-10:00
- went to bed early, barely could stay awake 
- had a dream where I got shot in the heart and it was the 90s, I was seemingly fine, but I was also really concerned I was going to die. No blood, just schlooped in there.
- we were at the Hereford house and mom was too distracted by her smartphone to put the SNES emergency services cartridge in the console. I was clearly dieing, but at a very slow rate. As I became weaker and more stressed out I would keep asking her to call the hospital via SNES. Eventually woke up and did not die.
- woke up very groggy but set my phone screen and flashlight to full brightness and shined it in my eyes to wake me up. Surprising side effect of writing logs is the bright screen's ability to wake me up. Should probably be less annoying about bugging people with phones
- mood: 6.5
## E2-2 20:32-21:05
- Good deep sleep, was pretty tired going into it so it felt necessary, definitely the deepest I've napped
  - man I wish I had some sleep sensors
- chasing the dragon pretty hard with caffeine these days
  - time out of mine steely dan
- coming out of it still feel tired, maybe 30 min naps will clean up the sleep debt
- mood 4.5
## E3-3 2:20-2:35
- Not really tired, bailed sleep early
- We are now going to attempt a dymaxion schedule
- keeping the naps is extremely important, blacking out the prius is now highest prio
# 8-15-2021
![](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_8_15_2021.svg)
- **Dynamaxion Commence!**
- the idea is to never let self get tired, sleep before that happens. 
- Four naps is the target, but if extremely tired, feel free to take an extra nap
  - **Each nap MUST be 30 mins**
  - **Primary Naps must be strictly adhered to**
## D4-1
- first nap, feeling good, a bit tired, cooking up some cafe
- did sleep, alarm went off 5 mins early, reorganized alarms
## D4-2
- feeling pretty groggy and pretty tired but that's just due to waking up during SWS
- Good amount of nap
## D4-3
- still pretty awake, having trouble falling straight into the nap, didn't sleep much
## D4-4/E2-1
- didn't even make it to this nap, instead I slept for 6 hours, it was becoming pretty painful. 
- Waking up mid-sws really is pretty difficult.
- maybe this schedule with 2 extended nap periods would be better
- not having a primary sleep period is kinda sad
- reverting to E2
# 8-16-2021
![](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_8_16_2021.svg)
- I've decided to stick with E2 until October 1st until I convert to E3. Advice on polyphasic.net says people generally have more success switching to E3 after several months of E2
## E2-2 00:30
- didnt initiate sleep on time due to distraction
- 30 min nap
- pretty groggy and rather tired but no problems waking up
- mood 6.9
# 8-17-2021
## E2-1
- overslept by one hour
## E2-2
- slept about 15 mins
- felt pretty rested
- mood 7.4
# 8-18-2021
##  E2-1
- overslept by 30 mins (intentionally working my way back to 4hr30)
- very groggy at wakeup
- wake self up with flashlight in my eyes
- mood 8
# 8-20-2021
## E2-3
- slept in Prius in front of the shop
- don't have blackouts on the windows yet
- did my best to nap, but cops and many other sounds meant I didn't really sleep
- Prius had potential though, it's like the van lite
- going to install blackout curtains now
# 8-28-2021
## E2-1
- overslept by 3 hours
- missed last night's naps
- not sleeping consistently enough
- how can I expect adaptation if I don't adhere precisely to a schedule?
- interesting dream about being a nurse, starting my first day in a hospital, mom showing me around. Theres a door right before the emergency room that leads down a dark staircase into a massive city of ember esque cenote. As I climb down the steps, the sky becomes more blue. There are lots of people and the scene turns into a beach before I get down to the bottom. I follow the shore to an old church ruin where a see a giant black hemi truck trailering a castle. It is intimidating. Not sure if it is friendly, I pause, but it opens fire and suddenly there are explosions everywhere. I jump behind the church ruin onto my stomach but hellfire is still raining down. I decide to make a run for it back to the wooden staircase far on the other side of the beach. I think about taking advice about running perpendicular to the attack, like a chicken but ignore the advice and continue running towards the wooden stairs. I am running full speed and I fear they will be destroyed before I make it. Half across the beach the alarm goes off and I wake up.
## E2-2
- nice nap, super tired, ate some dank pizza my bro made but I got tired from carbohydrate.
- Felt heavy strain in my upper chest, not pain, but an interesting pressure
- great sleep, almost failed and slept an extra 10 mins, but writing this and the previous log saved me and I've now woken up fully
- hyped to get back on this schedule
- mood: 7
## E2-3
- about an hour late to sleep (2:20)
- not too tired, but residual carbohydrates in my mouth created an uncomfortable sleep environment
- loud dishwashing noises downstairs making it difficult to sleep
- also excited about an idea to split Holdsworth scales into 2 4nps sections L&R Chiral
  - counterpart to Dorian is mixolydian
  - assign each scale to a Chinese character
# 8-29-2021
## E2-1
- overslept by 30 mins, went to bed an hour early
- missed the rest of the days naps
- really negative day, but there were some learning lessons
- need to really work on focusing on other people over myself
- muddy water is cleared best by leaving it alone -Allan Watts
- mood: 6-3
# 8-30-2021
## E2-1
- overslept by 1hr
- missed yesterday's naps
- mood 8
## E2-2
- late to sleep by 30 mins
- very tired
- didn't actually fall asleep but refreshing
- mood 8
# 9-1-2021
## E2-2
- Got to nap on time for the first time in a long time
- sleeping on hard ground hurts my fingers and toes
- does caffeine make it hard to focus?
# 9-8-2021
![sleep_9_08_2021](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_9_08_2021.svg)
- feeling very tired but less lethargic than last time I was down here (I flew back to Central America)
## E2-1
- woke up an hour early due to heat and noise
- El Salvador is an hour later anyway, so I'm going to shift the schedule back an hour- E2-1 to 5-9:30
## E2-2
- went on a grueling hike, napped from 17:00-21:00
- going to make 17:00 E2-2
## E2-3
- Not sure where I'm going to put this yet, skipping this nap due to the long E2-2 today
- mood 6.5
# 9-9-2021
![sleep_9_10_2021](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_9_10_2021.svg)
- adding 20 mins buffer to each sleep segment to account for time it takes to fall asleep
## E2-1
- 6hrs of sleep, woke up cause it got too hot
## E2-2
- Slept at 17:00 for 40 mins
## E2-3
- Slept at 23:00 for 40 mins
- moving nap back a bit
- I think there's something to this 20min nap cycle thing. 30mins is too little/too much. Gotta stick with naps that are multiple of 20 mins
- makes me wonder about 4-6 40min dynamaxion naps
  - yeah it exists, see triphasic sleep and core only
# 9-26-2021
![sleep_9_26_2021](../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep_9_26_2021.svg)
- Honduras is too hot to sleep during day
- car problems mean I can't nap consistently
- loud sounds everywhere
- reverting back to monophasic sleep
- experiment ends

<h2>Overall I enjoyed it very much, I was really productive during the night hours and sleeping more made the days feel relaxed. Contradictorily, I did sense my mood decrease and I was less excited about things than I usually am. But being more serious sometimes can be useful I suppose.</h2>
<h2>Going Polyphasic</h2>
<h3>8-3-2021 - Day 1</h3>
<p>As persistent procrastination precipitates the looming demolition of my happiness, I stare blankly at my computer- The clock strikes 4 in the morning. I have an important deadline tomorrow, and I can't stop reading about polyphasic sleep.<br />
Most nights I find myself with tasks unfinished, wondering if I should keep working or head in for a full 8 hours and resume the tasks in the morning. Usually, it's the former, and I'll end up cycling my sleep schedule around the clock, chasing the circadians until I'm waking up at 6 PM and all the coffee stores are closed. What a drag!<br />
But tonight was different, it had to be, I'd delayed this project long enough and I was going to finish it. Like a message from [insert deity], Wikipedia gifted me the perfect answer: Everyman 3 Extended. A significantly more reasonable alternative to the Uberman Polyphasic sleep pattern, Everyman would replace my monophasic 8 hour sleep period with one 4.5 hour period peppered with 3 daytime 20-minute naps, making for 5.5 daily hours of sleep. And that was that! I worked until 6 PM last night and woke up at 10:30 AM.<br />
And the project got finished! It may just be adrenalin, but it's the first time in a while I didn't feel stressed for time and had to search for things to do. It's why I'm writing a blog for the first time in almost a month!  </p>
<h3>8-5-2021 - Day 3</h3>
<p>To be honest, I haven't done enough research into this Polyphasic sleep thing. It may be a horrible idea- it's been around for a while and there could certainly be some enlightening research on the subject that disqualifies it completely.<br />
Knowing more is rapidly becoming a priority. I have read that most people before jumping into a polyphasic sleep schedule will plan out the transition ahead of time. I'm a bit too impulsive for that, but I will say that day 3 is going very well!<br />
It's 3:38 in the morning as I write this. My sleep plan ended up looking like this:
<center>
<img width=60% src="../src/blog/polyphasic/sleep.svg" /></img><br />
<em>This sleep graph is generated automatically from my calendar program by adding an [ALARM] tag to my TODOs</em>
</center><br />
Red zones mark my sleep periods. This is a pretty messed up perversion of Everyman 3 extended, but it felt the most natural to me. I tend to push my sleep schedule more and more into the night until I'm sleeping at 6 and waking at 3. It's very unideal. Now, I can get the best of both worlds by sleeping at dawn and waking up at 10 AM to get an early start on the day!  </p>
<h4>Unexpected Consequences of Frequent Napping</h4>
<p>By nap #7, I started to fall asleep quickly enough that I would actually dream. These are the kind of in-and-out of consciousness type of dreams I use to have after being totally sleep deprived during my early days in San Francisco. Put on a FlyLo album and drift through the textures of those beats.<br />
I find that every time I nap (I've completed my 9th nap at this point) I relax enough that the best of the idea of the day will pop in my head. I need to cope with the thought of not writing down the idea until I finish the nap, and usually I've been able to remember it after the alarm goes off  </p>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<p>An unexpected discovery from this experiment has been the time-to-sleep alarm. I've never before set an alarm when it's <em>time to sleep,</em> but it's fantastic! Even for a monophasic sleep pattern, I think it could be really helpful to be alerted when it's time to sleep.<br />
It fits perfectly with my Digital Soviet Russia idea - even though I have the freedom to do anything and everything, I need to implement structure in my life to get the things I want to do done. The idea is to use technology to read my todos and automatically structure the day around them. With this sleep pattern I know exactly when I will have breaks, and partnered with Pomodoro, I can stay refreshed for the next task.  </p>
<h4>Fear of the Alarm</h4>
<p>Something I've wondered about a lot is <em>fear of the alarm</em>. I read somewhere that the reason why people wake up a few minutes before the alarm clock rings is that the sound is extremely stressful to your brain. There must be a section of our brain that keeps time, and just seeing the notification "the alarm is set for 4 hours and 30 minutes from now" is enough to set this internal alarm clock just a few minutes ahead of the silicon one. I would love to experiment with this notification at some point and see what else I can trick my sleeping brain into doing.<br />
When it comes to napping, some improvement could be made to the alarm. Knowing the alarm will ring so loudly and violently makes it harder to fall asleep. I bet alarm clocks are more abusive to our brains than we realize. An alarm clock should wake you up gently. Gives me ideas for a watch with a vibration motor that connects to my second brain, an auto-scheduling Pomodoro, and this polyphasic sleep timer.  </p>

<h2>Theory of Permanent Discomfort</h2>
<h3>7-11-2021</h3>
<p><img style="float: right;" margin="20px" width="35%" src="../src/blog/permanent_discomfort/trotsky.webp"  />
Trotsky's <em>Permanent Revolution</em>, in a nutshell, is a theory on how to preserve classless society, also known as the Dictatorship of the Proletariat. Murdered by Ice Pick wielding NKVD agent Ramón Mercader at the order of fellow revolutionary Joseph Stalin, it is interesting to wonder whether Trotsky's ideas could have prevented the over-bureaucratization of the Soviet Union and consolidation of power that occurred after Stalin. Maybe, maybe not.  </p>

*what a guy*
</center>  -->
<p>On a much lighter note, <em>that kind</em> of literature has become a seed for my <em>Theory of Permanent Discomfort</em>. This is part of my Second Brain project, building a project-based notebook also does time tracking, generates invoices, and helps me improve my productivity.<br />
For a month now, I've been setting eight daily tasks for myself to complete. That's it! How hard can it be to complete eight tasks? Well as it turns out, somewhat hard to do consistently. Before I wrote this program, I didn't realize how often I was getting distracted by new ideas and projects, and while I haven't improved much in the last month, I now have metrics to measure my progress in this area. Every day, I set up tasks in my notebook: 
<center>
<img width=60% src="../src/blog/permanent_discomfort/permanent_discomfort_tasklist_example.png"></img><br />
<em>A global task list automatically generated from each project's TODO list</em>
</center><br />
As I check them off, a graph is generated that shows my progress that day and displays my average success rate for the previous two weeks:<br />
<center>
<img width=60% src="../src/blog/permanent_discomfort/task_graph.svg" /></img><br />
<em>Chart shows completed tasks in the last two weeks, and the average completion %</em>
</center><br />
Now that I can measure my Target/Goal ratio, I can make tangible improvements based on my results. I learned from Keto that <em>you can't make improvements without a way to measure progress.</em> And as you can see I still have a lot of progress to make. After I make my goal of eight tasks per day, I hope to slowly shore up my productivity and in a year reach 16 completed tasks per day. I expect a critical piece will be managing context switching, which has improved significantly since I started to care about my notebook.<br />
This brings us to the <em>carne importante</em> of this blog post, our <em>dénouement</em>: <em>The Theory of Permanent Discomfort</em>. Having run this experiment for a month now, I have noticed that I automatically poise tasks on the precipice of what is possible. I have consistently overreached and not made goals that I thought were attainable at the beginning of the day. So I have come to peace with the fact that I will not always make the goals, and allow the day to go uncompleted, even though I could modify the day's tasks to make me always succeed. Some days I find it exceptionally difficult to make all the goals, but having the metrics there keeps me motivated to make them.<br />
This is Permanent Discomfort - to know that not all goals will be met and to use that bit of failure as motivation to achieve more the next day.  </p>

<h2>Building a Second Brain</h2>
<h3>6-19-2021</h3>
<p>After listening to the excellent "Building a Second Brain" podcast, I decided to build my own second brain. In fact, this website is automatically generated from the brain, which in short, is my notebook. I won't explain in detail all the ideas of the podcast here, but some of my favorite things I've taken away from it are <em>Projects over Categories</em> and <em>Slow Burns</em>, or the concept of collecting ideas in notebooks whenever you have free time. <br />
I wrote my whole album like this, randomly jotting down ideas for songs and critiques every time I heard it. I was left with <em>so</em> many more ideas that just needed to be implemented, rather than having to think of fresh ideas while making music. For someone interested in notetaking, I can't recommend the podcast enough.<br />
After trying tons of notetaking apps, and an avid user of Google Keep, I've come to the conclusion that if you have the means (or not!), you should just write one yourself. You wouldn't want someone else designing your brain, would you? That almost sounds like...<br />
I settled on these goals:<br />
<code>- Markdown files, directory structure
  - _TODO.md file in each directory
- Calendar agregating todo lists, organize by date
- Invoice generator based on todos
  - time tracking by typing eg. <em>18:00-19:00</em> in a todo
</code>
The directory structure ends up looking like this:<br />
<code>src/
  gen_calendar.py
  gen_invoice.py
reading notes/
future_projects/
current_projects/
  finished_projects/
  proj1/
    proj1_TODO.md
    README.md
  monksevillair.github.io/
    monksevillair.github.io_TODO.md
    src/
      blog/
      espanol/
      music/
      transcriptions/
      index.html
      README.md
</code><br />
More info on the website later, but with this structure, if want to make anything public, I can move a project into the monksevillair.github.io directory and it will go live on the next push. Everything is tracked with git, synced to my phone with <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>, although I'd like to pull and push from my phone soon.</p>
<h4>Calendar App</h4>
<p>I used Google calendar for a long time, and I still like it, but having it seperated from my TODOs was a huge barrier to having an effective calendar. I wanted to generate a calendar automatically from my TODO lists globally. <em>gen_calendar.py</em> automatically scans all the todo files</p>
<h4>Invoice App</h4>
<p>Many invoices and mucho dinero has been frittered as a result of my deep hatred for generating invoices. What better way to fix this problem than to generate them automatically from my todos? If I add eg. *18:00-19:00* to a TODO.md file, <em>gen_invoice.py</em> will add that todo to a global invoice maker</p>
<h4>Where does this all run?</h4>
<p>At the moment, in github actions. It's sick. The website generates and commits a new version every hr, which is how the background color changes. Eventually it will do other dynamic things. I use <a href="../.github/workflows/python-app.yml">this</a> workflow.<br />
When editing locally I run this script which scans for files locally and runs the python scripts when a file changes:<br />
<code>find ./ | entr sh -c "python3 ../src/calendar_todo.py &gt; calendar.html"</code><br />
I plan to run these scripts on my Pixel 3a running Ubuntu Touch, which will also run the alarm and GPS tracking in my van. Soon there will be a map page logging my travels in my van, Allan Holdsworth.
Much more to come on this stuff, when it's more mature I'll make my second brain public, maybe it would be useful for someone! Shout out to the Second Brain podcast!</p>

<p>I use to work at 3D Robotics, and managed to hack every component of the Solo while I was there. I one point they purged all their old electronics and some of it went to me and some other intern friends. I got a ton of ESCs for the solo drone, and have been using them for any project that involves small brushless motors.  </p>

<h2>Life on the Hook</h2>
<h3>5-1-2020</h3>
<p>I got the bright idea to find a spot to park my sailboat somewhere in the San Francisco Bay and see how long I could live out there. The adventure lasted far longer than I expected and with it brought moments of peace peppered with short periods of dread and general wetness. This is the story of a sailor, sailboat, sailrights, and <a href="https://eattheworld.bandcamp.com/track/sahalie">Sahalie</a>.<br />
I can tell you what brought us to do this: free rent. This is the Bay Area, the highest cost of living in the world. The year before I bought my first sailboat and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a18930170/diy-sailboat/">set it up with an electric motor</a>, partly to escape the high rent cost and mostly for the adventure. It was and excellent choice, and I scaled a serious learning curve getting that boat sail worthy.<br />

<h3>A Small Survey With A Big Soda</h3>
<p>My friend <a href="http://bigsodamusic.com/">Big Soda</a>, a fellow boat dweller and an incredible musician, joined me for the first day of surveying. Armed with an 8' PVC pipe, we set to probe out our target location in San Leandro Bay - a small bay that joins the south Alameda channel to the San Francisco Bay. We identified this location on USCG Chart 18649 as part of General Anchorage 9, meaning no restrictions for anchoring. I even called around the Coast Guard Offices and confirmed this was an OK spot to anchor long term! Alright!
The only caveats - much of the area is 1ft deep at low tide, with a few deep spots at around 7ft deep. Our boats have drafts of 6ft and 5ft. From our survey we found we had a 50ft diameter valley we could park our boats in and not strike ground. This isn't enough room to have good scope, so we decided we'd set up 4 large danforth anchors on the corners of the boats. This has the major disadvantage of not allowing the boats to swing into the direction of the current, putting a lot of force on the anchors and cleats. However, this area is pretty protected, and while we were there, we made it through a couple of 30mph wind storms with no dragging. But this method of mooring was absolutely a big unknown.<br />

<h3>Patiently Preparing Allan Holdsworth's Red Herring</h3>
<p>We need ropes, anchors, chain, solar, reverse osmosis, inverter, internet beaming, transport boats, food, refregeration, hot water. Welll - at least some of that. Our vigor was great for our productivity - but looking back we could have used a bit more time preparing. Hard to say though, part of the fun was using my battery powered soldering iron to finish the solar system while we were anchored. I ended up strapping two huge <a href="http://www.solardesigntool.com/components/module-panel-solar/Itek-Energy/2783/iT-295-HE/specification-data-sheet.html">295W Itek Residential Solar Panels</a> to the back of my Sailboat. I got them from a local solar retailer that had a surplus of used panels - $100 with a warantee! Incredibly they fit perfectly in the back of my prius, and even came with stacking feet.
</br>
</br>
I installed a propane water heater for the shower, and we set off. Opening bridges with the VHF was an exciting experience.
</br>
<img src="../src/blog/Sailboat/bridge%20opening.jpg" title="Boat Bridge Opening"style="float: right;" width="50%" margin="20px" /></p>
<h3>30 Days and 30 Nights</h3>
<p>We took off on the night of December 1st, 2019. High tide was against us, since we'd gotten a late start. At 3 knots we navigated the Park St, Fruitvale St, and High St bridges by the light of the moon and streetlights. It was loads of fun, but it takes focus to hold the boat in place while the bridge was opening under a quick tide.
We took Big Soda's 1961 Seafarer 31 that night, since it had a shallower draft we could feel out our little deep spot and if we got stuck, maybe get stuck less. When we finally made it to our Google Maps markers from our survey, we dropped anchor and packed up for the night. We took we woke up several times that night to check our depth with a skillet tied to a rope, anchor tension, and our GPS drift. I can't recommend enough having an anchor alarm for this type of boating, it helps with peace of mind.
But my god what a beautiful spot it was at low tide:
</br>
</br>
Those little black spots were thousands of birds, and over the hours you could watch the land rise out of the sea and trap our boat in a puddle. At certain times it was treacherous. The metal stakes that marked the edges of the channel threatend to pop our inflatable dinghies when you couldn't see them at mid-tide, there were times you couldn't row against the tide, and when I did get stuck in the mud, stepping in it sucked in my leg up to my boot.
Absolutely one of the best places I've anchored, and a hidden treasure of the bay area if you plan well.</p>
<h3>Is that a helicopter?</h3>
<p>Several days later I was woken up by a helicopter circling the boat, spouting unintelligible band-passed questions. I crawled up on deck and sat there looking up at it. Is that for me? Are the messing with me? Looking closer it was definitely a Coast Guard Helicopter - they probably they thought I was in trouble. After giving them several thumbs up they took off, but I was definitely concerned about what the hell they were up to.
</br>
</br>
I took my dinghy to shore and later that day I gave a call to Coast Guard Island, which is right down the channel. They told me an SOS signal was being sent from my location - and they were making their way to my boat right now. There were no other boats around, and this made no sense, but I jumped back in the dinghy and planed over there. The Coast Guard Officers were super cool, they helped me tear apart the boat for a supposedly water activated SOS life jacket. I had torn the boat apart several times before, and I had the sneaking suspicion they just wanted to see if I had drugs.

<h3>Busted by the Cops</h3>
<p>December 21, 2019. Big Soda and I get woken up by a man shouting "This is the Police" over the load speaker. We scrambled out on deck, and sure enough there was the East Bay Regional Park Police, and they asked us to board the boat. Initially I refused, but at some point I let them on (fatal mistake) and they ticketed me for a ripped life preserver. They also issued us an illegal camping permit. I showed them the USCG maps, that is was clearly marked as Anchorage 9, but they wouldn't have a bit of it. We were out February 1st, or they'd tow the boats. <a href="../src/blog/Sailboat/2019%20San%20Leandro%20Bay%20Jurisdiction%20Report.pdf">I made a jurisdiction map</a>, and presented it to them, but they still wouldn't budge. I heard from one of the officers that out the people with houses on shore were complaining about us, and a woman from the parks department had been begging them for a week to get us out.
</br>
</br>
Arg an excellent experiment matey, alas, we turn home and head for the motherland.
