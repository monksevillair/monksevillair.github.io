	   <h2>Building a Second Brain</h2>
<h3>6-19-2021</h3>
<p>After listening to the excellent "Building a Second Brain" podcast, I decided to build my own second brain. In fact, this website is automatically generated from the brain, which in short, is my notebook. I won't explain in detail all the ideas of the podcast here, but some of my favorite things I've taken away from it are __Projects over Categories_ and <em>Slow Burns</em>, or the concept of collecting ideas in notebooks whenever you have free time. <br />
I wrote my whole album like this, randomly jotting down ideas for songs and critiques every time I heard it. I was left with <em>so</em> many more ideas that just needed to be implemented, rather than having to think of fresh ideas while making music. For someone interested in notetaking, I can't recommend the podcast enough.<br />
And yes, I use emacs, and I've tried org-mode. But as <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Links">gwern</a> says: "Friends don't let friends use heroin or org-mode" - great advice.<br />
After trying tons of notetaking apps, and an avid user of Google Keep, I've come to the conclusion that if you have the means (or not!), you should just write one yourself. You wouldn't want someone else designing your brain, would you? That almost sounds like...<br />
I settled on these goals:<br />
<code>- Markdown files, directory structure
  - _TODO.md file in each directory
- Calendar agregating todo lists, organize by date
- Invoice generator based on todos
  - time tracking by typing eg. <em>18:00-19:00</em> in a todo
</code>
The directory structure ends up looking like this:<br />
<code>src/
  gen_calendar.py
  gen_invoice.py
reading notes/
future_projects/
current_projects/
  finished_projects/
  proj1/
    proj1_TODO.md
    README.md
  monksevillair.github.io/
    monksevillair.github.io_TODO.md
    src/
      blog/
      espanol/
      music/
      transcriptions/
      index.html
      README.md
</code><br />
More info on the website later, but with this structure, if want to make anything public, I can move a project into the monksevillair.github.io directory and it will go live on the next push. Everything is tracked with git, synced to my phone with <a href="https://syncthing.net/">syncthing</a>, although I'd like to pull and push from my phone soon.</p>
<h4>Calendar App</h4>
<p>I used Google calendar for a long time, and I still like it, but having it seperated from my TODOs was a huge barrier to having an effective calendar. I wanted to generate a calendar automatically from my TODO lists globally. <em>gen_calendar.py</em> automatically scans all the todo files</p>
<h4>Invoice App</h4>
<p>Many invoices and mucho dinero has been frittered as a result of my deep hatred for generating invoices. What better way to fix this problem than to generate them automatically from my todos? If I add eg. *18:00-19:00* to a TODO.md file, <em>gen_invoice.py</em> will add that todo to a global invoice maker</p>
<h4>Where does this all run?</h4>
<p>At the moment, in github actions. It's sick. The website generates and commits a new version every hr, which is how the background color changes. Eventually it will do other dynamic things. I use <a href="../.github/workflows/python-app.yml">this</a> workflow.<br />
When editing locally I run this script which scans for files locally and runs the python scripts when a file changes:<br />
<code>find ./ | entr sh -c "python3 ../src/calendar_todo.py &gt; calendar.html"</code><br />
I plan to run these scripts on my Pixel 3a running Ubuntu Touch, which will also run the alarm and GPS tracking in my van. Soon there will be a map page logging my travels in my van, Allan Holdsworth.
Much more to come on this stuff, when it's more mature I'll make my second brain public, maybe it would be useful for someone! Shout out to the Second Brain podcast!</p>

<h2>3DR Solo ESCs</h2>
<h3>3-14-2019</h3>
<p><img src="../src/blog/images/solo_esc_wiring.jpg" style="float: right;" width="30%" margin="20px" />
I use to work at 3D Robotics, and managed to hack every component of the Solo while I was there. I one point they purged all their old electronics and some of it went to me and some other intern friends. I got a ton of ESCs for the solo drone, and have been using them for any project that involves small brushless motors.  </p>

<h2>Life on the Hook</h2>
<h3>5-1-2020</h3>
<p>I got the bright idea to find a spot to park my sailboat somewhere in the San Francisco Bay and see how long I could live out there. The adventure lasted far longer than I expected and with it brought moments of peace peppered with short periods of dread and general wetness. This is the story of a sailor, sailboat, sailrights, and <a href="https://eattheworld.bandcamp.com/track/sahalie">Sahalie</a>.<br />
I can tell you what brought us to do this: free rent. This is the Bay Area, the highest cost of living in the world. The year before I bought my first sailboat and <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a18930170/diy-sailboat/">set it up with an electric motor</a>, partly to escape the high rent cost and mostly for the adventure. It was and excellent choice, and I scaled a serious learning curve getting that boat sail worthy.<br />

<h3>A Small Survey With A Big Soda</h3>
<p>My friend <a href="http://bigsodamusic.com/">Big Soda</a>, a fellow boat dweller and an incredible musician, joined me for the first day of surveying. Armed with an 8' PVC pipe, we set to probe out our target location in San Leandro Bay - a small bay that joins the south Alameda channel to the San Francisco Bay. We identified this location on USCG Chart 18649 as part of General Anchorage 9, meaning no restrictions for anchoring. I even called around the Coast Guard Offices and confirmed this was an OK spot to anchor long term! Alright!
The only caveats - much of the area is 1ft deep at low tide, with a few deep spots at around 7ft deep. Our boats have drafts of 6ft and 5ft. From our survey we found we had a 50ft diameter valley we could park our boats in and not strike ground. This isn't enough room to have good scope, so we decided we'd set up 4 large danforth anchors on the corners of the boats. This has the major disadvantage of not allowing the boats to swing into the direction of the current, putting a lot of force on the anchors and cleats. However, this area is pretty protected, and while we were there, we made it through a couple of 30mph wind storms with no dragging. But this method of mooring was absolutely a big unknown.<br />

<h3>Patiently Preparing Allan Holdsworth's Red Herring</h3>
<p>We need ropes, anchors, chain, solar, reverse osmosis, inverter, internet beaming, transport boats, food, refregeration, hot water. Welll - at least some of that. Our vigor was great for our productivity - but looking back we could have used a bit more time preparing. Hard to say though, part of the fun was using my battery powered soldering iron to finish the solar system while we were anchored. I ended up strapping two huge <a href="http://www.solardesigntool.com/components/module-panel-solar/Itek-Energy/2783/iT-295-HE/specification-data-sheet.html">295W Itek Residential Solar Panels</a> to the back of my Sailboat. I got them from a local solar retailer that had a surplus of used panels - $100 with a warantee! Incredibly they fit perfectly in the back of my prius, and even came with stacking feet.
</br>
</br>
I installed a propane water heater for the shower, and we set off. Opening bridges with the VHF was an exciting experience.
</br>
<img src="../src/blog/Sailboat/bridge%20opening.jpg" title="Boat Bridge Opening"style="float: right;" width="50%" margin="20px" /></p>
<h3>30 Days and 30 Nights</h3>
<p>We took off on the night of December 1st, 2019. High tide was against us, since we'd gotten a late start. At 3 knots we navigated the Park St, Fruitvale St, and High St bridges by the light of the moon and streetlights. It was loads of fun, but it takes focus to hold the boat in place while the bridge was opening under a quick tide.
We took Big Soda's 1961 Seafarer 31 that night, since it had a shallower draft we could feel out our little deep spot and if we got stuck, maybe get stuck less. When we finally made it to our Google Maps markers from our survey, we dropped anchor and packed up for the night. We took we woke up several times that night to check our depth with a skillet tied to a rope, anchor tension, and our GPS drift. I can't recommend enough having an anchor alarm for this type of boating, it helps with peace of mind.
But my god what a beautiful spot it was at low tide:
</br>
</br>
Those little black spots were thousands of birds, and over the hours you could watch the land rise out of the sea and trap our boat in a puddle. At certain times it was treacherous. The metal stakes that marked the edges of the channel threatend to pop our inflatable dinghies when you couldn't see them at mid-tide, there were times you couldn't row against the tide, and when I did get stuck in the mud, stepping in it sucked in my leg up to my boot.
Absolutely one of the best places I've anchored, and a hidden treasure of the bay area if you plan well.</p>
<h3>Is that a helicopter?</h3>
<p>Several days later I was woken up by a helicopter circling the boat, spouting unintelligible band-passed questions. I crawled up on deck and sat there looking up at it. Is that for me? Are the messing with me? Looking closer it was definitely a Coast Guard Helicopter - they probably they thought I was in trouble. After giving them several thumbs up they took off, but I was definitely concerned about what the hell they were up to.
</br>
</br>
I took my dinghy to shore and later that day I gave a call to Coast Guard Island, which is right down the channel. They told me an SOS signal was being sent from my location - and they were making their way to my boat right now. There were no other boats around, and this made no sense, but I jumped back in the dinghy and planed over there. The Coast Guard Officers were super cool, they helped me tear apart the boat for a supposedly water activated SOS life jacket. I had torn the boat apart several times before, and I had the sneaking suspicion they just wanted to see if I had drugs.

<h3>Busted by the Cops</h3>
<p>December 21, 2019. Big Soda and I get woken up by a man shouting "This is the Police" over the load speaker. We scrambled out on deck, and sure enough there was the East Bay Regional Park Police, and they asked us to board the boat. Initially I refused, but at some point I let them on (fatal mistake) and they ticketed me for a ripped life preserver. They also issued us an illegal camping permit. I showed them the USCG maps, that is was clearly marked as Anchorage 9, but they wouldn't have a bit of it. We were out February 1st, or they'd tow the boats. <a href="../src/blog/Sailboat/2019%20San%20Leandro%20Bay%20Jurisdiction%20Report.pdf">I made a jurisdiction map</a>, and presented it to them, but they still wouldn't budge. I heard from one of the officers that out the people with houses on shore were complaining about us, and a woman from the parks department had been begging them for a week to get us out.
</br>
</br>
Arg an excellent experiment matey, alas, we turn home and head for the motherland.
