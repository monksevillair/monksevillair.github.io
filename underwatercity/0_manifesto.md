# Path to an Underwater Future: Near-Term Focus & Long-Term Vision

My immediate focus for this month (May 2025) is to prepare and sell my van. The proceeds and freed-up time will support my move to Key Largo, where I plan to immerse myself in the diving community, get involved with underwater habitat projects, and take scuba and dance classes at the local community college. This is a foundational step towards my ultimate goal of building an underwater city.

## The Ultimate Goal: Building an Underwater City

Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1.  **Generate significant capital to acquire necessary resources:** Initially, this will involve strategic life changes (like selling the van and relocating to a hub for marine activities). Longer-term, this could involve mapping the Ocean with ROVs.
2.  **Build human submarine modules:** These will be capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation.
3.  **Live full time underwater:** Explore the new frontier of the underwater world!
