# Building an Underwater City
Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1. Generate significant capital to aquire necessary resources by mapping the Ocean with ROVs
2. Build human submarine modules capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation
3. Live full time underwater, explore the new frontier of the underwater world!


1. Generate significant capital to aquire necessary resources.
  In order to build an underwater city, we will need significant resources. This will be best done by interfacing with the economy and generating significant value. I would also like to use this time to generate some new skills.

Skills I will aquire this summer:
- Welding
- CNC Plasma cutting

Skills I will aquire in fall:
- CNC

I will organize my life from every year from now until I am 69. I am currently 27 years old

__Age__
## Part 1. ROVS
27. Learn CNC Plasma Cutting and Welding, Begin Designing a long range ROV, start and underwater city discord, actively use twitter and collect people for the journey
28. Autonomously map a large section of the ocean, looking for shipwrecks and scientifically interesting material. Google streetview for the ocean
29. Scale up production of ROVs to 100/year. ROVs will be used to identify a good location for the first underwater habitat near volcanically active areas for power generation

## Part 2. Human Submarines
31. Begin production of very large polycarbonate domes
32. Master dome construction for large human-carrying submarines
33. Explore the ocean and sell the best human-carrying subs available

## Part 3. Giant Submarines
35. Increase size of polycarb domes. Complete the first self-sustaining underwater habitat with a detachable tailcone making the house more hydrodynamic for movement.
36. Add all necessary living amenities. Lease habitat for scientific missions and a west-coast hotel
37. Scale up production to 100/year
38. Move several modular habitats to previously discovered volcano-proximate location for power generation
39. Build basic "town" infrastructure. Powerplant.
40.
