# Building an Underwater City
Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1. Generate significant capital to aquire necessary resources by mapping the Ocean with ROVs
2. Build human submarine modules capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation
3. Live full time underwater, explore the new frontier of the underwater world!


1. Generate significant capital to aquire necessary resources.
  In order to build an underwater city, we will need significant resources. This will be best done by interfacing with the economy and generating significant value. I would also like to use this time to generate some new skills.

Skills I will aquire this summer:
- Welding
- CNC Plasma cutting

Skills I will aquire in fall:
- CNC

I will organize my life from every year from now until I am 69. I am currently 27 years old

        Wednesday, May 14th: Plan your commute/travel to the college campus and confirm parking or public transport options.
        Thursday, May 15th: Research basic types of sensors relevant to ocean floor mapping (e.g., sonar, cameras).
        Friday, May 16th: Organize any digital folders or physical notebooks you'll use for your college coursework.
        Saturday, May 17th: Brainstorm 3-5 key performance indicators (KPIs) for your ROV (e.g., survey speed, data resolution).
        Sunday, May 18th: Pack your bag with any necessary supplies for the first day of your college classes.

Following Week (May 19th - May 25th, 2025)

    Weekly Goal: Develop a preliminary block diagram of the ROV's main systems and begin outlining the content for your underwater city Discord server.
        Monday, May 19th: Sketch a simple block diagram showing how major ROV systems (e.g., power, propulsion, sensors, communication) might connect.
        Tuesday, May 20th: List potential categories or channels for your underwater city Discord server (e.g., #announcements, #rov-design, #welding-tips).
        Wednesday, May 21st: Research basic power system options for long-endurance underwater vehicles.
        Thursday, May 22nd: Draft a welcome message or basic rules for your future Discord server.
        Friday, May 23rd: Research common communication and control methods for ROVs.
        Saturday, May 24th: Think about the initial roles you might want for your Discord server (e.g., moderator, ROV expert).
        Sunday, May 25th: Briefly review your ROV concept sketches and block diagram, noting any immediate questions or areas for more research.

Last Week of May (May 26th - May 31st, 2025)

    Weekly Goal: Consolidate your initial ROV research into a brief concept overview and mentally prepare for the intensive schedule of your upcoming courses.
        Monday, May 26th (Memorial Day): Write a one-page summary of your ROV concept, including its mission, key features, and potential challenges.
        Tuesday, May 27th: Identify 1-2 online communities or forums related to ROV building or ocean exploration to observe or join later.
        Wednesday, May 28th: Review the syllabi for your courses (if available online) and note any initial questions you might have.
        Thursday, May 29th: Ensure your workspace for studying and ROV design (even if it's just digital) is organized and ready.
        Friday, May 30th: Set some personal learning goals for what you hope to achieve in the first month of your welding and metalworking classes.
        Saturday, May 31st: Rest and mentally prepare for the start of your college classes, ensuring you are ready for the time commitment.


June 2025: Immerse yourself in your "Introduction to Welding" and "Introduction to Metalworking" courses, focusing on mastering the fundamental skills, and launch your underwater city Discord server.
July 2025: Continue to excel in your college courses, begin applying learned concepts to your ROV design (e.g., material selection, basic fabrication considerations), and start actively building your Twitter presence by sharing your journey and connecting with relevant communities.
August 2025: Successfully complete your summer college courses, solidifying your welding and metalworking knowledge, and refine your ROV design with a focus on manufacturability using your new skills.
September 2025: Begin your fall learning focus on CNC, and start detailed design work on the frame and structural components of your long-range ROV, considering how CNC plasma cutting will be utilized.
October 2025: Continue to develop your CNC knowledge and apply it to designing the more complex components of the ROV, such as enclosures for electronics or mounting systems, while consistently engaging with and growing your Discord and Twitter communities.
November 2025: Integrate your CNC and welding/metalworking knowledge to finalize the primary structural and mechanical designs for the ROV, and begin sourcing materials and components.
December 2025: Develop a comprehensive plan for the Q1 2026 fabrication of your first ROV prototype and continue to expand your online network, seeking potential collaborators or mentors for your project.

28. Autonomously map a large section of the ocean, looking for shipwrecks and scientifically interesting material. Google streetview for the ocean
29. Scale up production of ROVs to 100/year. ROVs will be used to identify a good location for the first underwater habitat near volcanically active areas for power generation

## Part 2. Human Submarines
31. Begin production of very large polycarbonate domes
32. Master dome construction for large human-carrying submarines
33. Explore the ocean and sell the best human-carrying subs available

## Part 3. Giant Submarines
35. Increase size of polycarb domes. Complete the first self-sustaining underwater habitat with a detachable tailcone making the house more hydrodynamic for movement.
36. Add all necessary living amenities. Lease habitat for scientific missions and a west-coast hotel
37. Scale up production to 100/year
38. Move several modular habitats to previously discovered volcano-proximate location for power generation
