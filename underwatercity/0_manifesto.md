# Building an Underwater City

Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.



1. Generate significant capital to acquire necessary resources by mapping the Ocean with ROVs  
2. Build human submarine modules capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation  
3. Live full time underwater, explore the new frontier of the underwater world!

2. **Tuesday, May 20:** List channels/categories for your Discord (e.g., #announcements, #rov‑design).  
3. **Wednesday, May 21:** Research power‑system options for long‑endurance ROVs.  
4. **Thursday, May 22:** Draft a welcome message and rules for Discord.  
5. **Friday, May 23:** Research communication/control methods for ROVs.  
6. **Saturday, May 24:** Define initial Discord roles (moderator, ROV expert).  
7. **Sunday, May 25:** Review your sketches and block diagram; note open questions.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Week of May 26–31, 2025 (Last Week of May)</summary>
