# Path to an Underwater Future: Near-Term Focus & Long-Term Vision

My immediate focus for this month (May 2025) is to complete and upgrade my van's interior to make it highly sellable. While some major components (cabinets, bathroom, shower, toilet) are already in place, I'll be concentrating on specific enhancements. In order of importance, these are: replacing the floors, upgrading the lighting, building a 1-person bed with bike storage, finishing the wood wall paneling, constructing a small kitchen area, and adding trim to finish the gaps. This will be my top priority. In parallel, I will be researching opportunities in Key Largo (diving, underwater habitat involvement, scuba/dance classes) to prepare for my next steps once the van is sold. The van sale will fund this transition, a foundational step towards my ultimate goal of building an underwater city.

## The Ultimate Goal: Building an Underwater City

Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1.  **Generate significant capital to acquire necessary resources:** Initially, this will involve strategic life changes (like completing and selling the van, then relocating to a hub for marine activities). Longer-term, this could involve mapping the Ocean with ROVs.
2.  **Build human submarine modules:** These will be capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation.
3.  **Live full time underwater:** Explore the new frontier of the underwater world!

<summary>Year 27 (2025): Van Interior Upgrade & Sale, Prepare for Key Largo</summary>

**Primary Focus:** Execute targeted upgrades and completions for the van interior (floors, lighting, bed, walls, small kitchen, trim) to maximize its sale value. Successfully sell the van.

**Secondary Focus (Concurrent):** Thoroughly research and plan for relocation to Key Largo, including identifying diving opportunities, underwater habitat projects, and relevant community college courses (scuba, dance).

**Tertiary Focus (Time Permitting):** Continue preliminary research and community building for the long-range ROV and underwater city concept (e.g., Discord, Twitter).

<details>
<summary>May 2025: Van Upgrades & Key Largo Research</summary>

**Overall Goals for May:**
* **Van:** Make significant progress on the prioritized list of interior upgrades. Aim to complete flooring, lighting, and bed construction, with wall paneling well underway.
* **Key Largo:** Conduct comprehensive research into Key Largo opportunities, making initial contacts and gathering information for a potential move post-van sale.

<summary>Week ending May 11, 2025 (Rest of This Weekend - Current Date: Saturday, May 10)</summary>

- **Saturday, May 10, 2025 (Today):**
    - **Van (Priority Tasks):**
        - **Flooring (Task 1):** Research suitable nicer flooring options (e.g., vinyl plank, engineered hardwood, rubber). Measure floor area accurately. Obtain cost estimates and identify local suppliers.
        - **Lighting (Task 2):** Brainstorm and research "better lighting" options (e.g., LED puck lights, strip LEDs, dimmable fixtures). Assess current wiring – can it be reused/adapted or is new wiring needed? Sketch a basic lighting plan.
        - **Bed Design (Task 3):** Start designing the 1-person bed. Crucially, measure your bike(s) to determine the required clearance for underneath storage. Sketch out frame ideas and consider materials (wood, metal).
    - **Key Largo Research (Secondary):** Conduct initial online searches for dive centers, community colleges (course catalogs for scuba/dance), and general information about living in Key Largo.
- **Sunday, May 11, 2025:**
    - **Van (Priority Tasks):**
        - **Flooring (Task 1):** Finalize flooring choice. If a decision is made and materials can be sourced today (check store hours/online availability for quick shipping), purchase them. Plan for old floor removal.
        - **Lighting (Task 2):** Finalize lighting plan & fixture choices. Purchase new lights and any necessary wiring, switches, or connectors.
        - **Bed Design (Task 3):** Refine bed design and create a materials list for construction.
        - **Wall Paneling (Task 4):** Inspect areas needing wood wall covering. Measure these sections and estimate the quantity of wood paneling required. Research wood types and finishes.
    - **Key Largo Research (Secondary):** Broad search for marine conservation groups, underwater habitat restoration projects, or related volunteer opportunities in the Florida Keys.

<details>
<summary>Week of May 12–18, 2025 (Focus: Flooring, Lighting Installation, Bed Frame Construction)</summary>

- **Van (Primary Focus Daily):**
    - **Flooring (Task 1):** Remove existing flooring. Prepare the subfloor (clean, level if needed). Begin installing the new flooring. This is often a multi-day task.
    - **Lighting (Task 2):** Once flooring allows for easier movement/access, or in parallel if feasible, begin installing the new lighting fixtures. Run any new wiring carefully and safely (consult electrician or guides if unsure).
    - **Bed (Task 3):** Start sourcing materials for the bed. Begin construction of the bed frame, prioritizing the bike storage dimensions.
- **Key Largo Research (Evening/Breaks):**
    - Compile a detailed list of dive shops in Key Largo with contact info, course offerings, and potential job/internship notes.
    - Identify 2-3 specific underwater habitat projects or marine conservation organizations that seem like a good fit.
    - Investigate community college admission requirements, application deadlines (Summer/Fall), and registration processes for scuba and dance classes.
