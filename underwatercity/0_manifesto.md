# Path to an Underwater Future: Near-Term Focus & Long-Term Vision

My immediate focus for this month (May 2025) is to design and build out a complete interior for my van to make it highly sellable. This is a significant project that will be my top priority. In parallel, I will be researching opportunities in Key Largo (diving, underwater habitat involvement, scuba/dance classes) to prepare for my next steps once the van is sold. The van sale will fund this transition, which is a foundational step towards my ultimate goal of building an underwater city.

## The Ultimate Goal: Building an Underwater City

Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1.  **Generate significant capital to acquire necessary resources:** Initially, this will involve strategic life changes (like building out and selling the van, then relocating to a hub for marine activities). Longer-term, this could involve mapping the Ocean with ROVs.
2.  **Build human submarine modules:** These will be capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation.
3.  **Live full time underwater:** Explore the new frontier of the underwater world!

<summary>Year 27 (2025): Van Interior Build & Sale, Prepare for Key Largo</summary>

**Primary Focus:** Design and execute a full interior build-out for the van to maximize its sale value. Successfully sell the van.

**Secondary Focus (Concurrent):** Thoroughly research and plan for relocation to Key Largo, including identifying diving opportunities, underwater habitat projects, and relevant community college courses (scuba, dance).

**Tertiary Focus (Time Permitting):** Continue preliminary research and community building for the long-range ROV and underwater city concept (e.g., Discord, Twitter).

<summary>May 2025: Intensive Van Interior Build & Key Largo Research</summary>

**Overall Goals for May:**
* **Van:** Finalize interior design, procure materials, and make significant progress on the van build (framing, insulation, paneling, basic structures). Aim to have the van ready for finishing touches by month-end.
* **Key Largo:** Conduct comprehensive research into Key Largo opportunities, making initial contacts and gathering information for a potential move post-van sale.

<summary>Week ending May 11, 2025 (Rest of This Weekend)</summary>

- **Saturday, May 10, 2025 (Today):**
    - **Van (Priority):** Begin detailed design of the van interior layout. Research build styles, materials (e.g., wood types, insulation, flooring, hardware), and create a comprehensive budget. Measure interior dimensions accurately. Develop a preliminary materials list.
    - **Key Largo Research (Secondary):** Conduct initial online searches for dive centers, community colleges (course catalogs for scuba/dance), and general information about living in Key Largo.
- **Sunday, May 11, 2025:**
    - **Van (Priority):** Finalize van interior design plans and materials list. Start sourcing materials (online orders, identify local suppliers). If feasible, begin any necessary demolition of existing van interior or prepare surfaces for the new build.
    - **Key Largo Research (Secondary):** Broad search for marine conservation groups, underwater habitat restoration projects, or related volunteer opportunities in the Florida Keys.
