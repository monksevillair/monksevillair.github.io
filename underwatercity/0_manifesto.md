# Path to an Underwater Future: Near-Term Focus & Long-Term Vision

My immediate focus for this month (May 2025) is to complete and upgrade my van's interior to make it highly sellable. While some major components (cabinets, bathroom, shower, toilet) are already in place, I'll be concentrating on specific enhancements. In order of importance, these are: replacing the floors, upgrading the lighting, building a 1-person bed with bike storage, finishing the wood wall paneling, constructing a small kitchen area, and adding trim to finish the gaps. This will be my top priority. In parallel, I will be researching opportunities in Key Largo (diving, underwater habitat involvement, scuba/dance classes) to prepare for my next steps once the van is sold. The van sale will fund this transition, a foundational step towards my ultimate goal of building an underwater city.

## The Ultimate Goal: Building an Underwater City

Preliminary plans for building an underwater city.

1.  **Generate significant capital to acquire necessary resources:** Initially, this will involve strategic life changes (like completing and selling the van, then relocating to a hub for marine activities). Longer-term, this could involve mapping the Ocean with ROVs.
2.  **Build human submarine modules:** These will be capable of ocean exploration, science, and permanent habitation.
3.  **Live full time underwater:** Explore the new frontier of the underwater world!
