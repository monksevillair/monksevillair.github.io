#### Surface piercing props by Paul Kamen

- typically waterline passes through hub - is this required?
- larger prop, more efficiency, momentum theory, low geer ratio
- cavitation happens pretty easily because 1atm is only 14.7psi
  - if suction on low pressure side on prop dips below ambient pressure,
vacuum cavity forms
  - water vapor cavity
- sucking in air prevents cavitation damage/water ram effect
- there is 1 ATM pushing backwards (could be more of Problem for small prop)
- shaft produces drag
- adjust prop submergence is like controlling prop pitch
- can allow for shallow draft
- prop must not be too close to transom
- openFOAM CFD
- Lower vibration
- reverse can be worse
- could make a variable pitch prop with a huge hub!
