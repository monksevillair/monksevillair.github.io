- some kinda bondo/clay type juice, plank sanding
- mark waterline with laser, flipit
- staple gun is a useful tool

#### Review
- wood structures are easy to manually mold into the shape you like, but in
the age of computers strikes me as not the most efficient way to get the
task done
  - respect to the artisanalness
  - useful techniques for something highly aesthetic!
