## Fwd: `study` West System Cold Molded Bo 
### Wednesday, July 20 2022  
### Vicem Yachts - Cold Molding Method  
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TuXUyweVyE  
- layer veneers at 90degrees  
- Vicem Yachts  
- cnc foam  
- keel made from mahogany  
- keel, cnc battens, stringers super simple mold  
![mold]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im1.png")  
- transom, stiffeners, chine clamp, spray rail  
- 45deg angle, galvanized nails  
![veneers]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im2.png")  
- epoxy, stainless staples  
- 10oz eglass on inside and out  
- deck made from thin plywood  
- mirror finish  
  - undercoat, epoxy fairing, longboard and machine sanding, multiple coats  
of epoxy primer and polyurethane paint  
- longboard sanding

#### Review  
- still very intricate, could be more computerized  
  
### Boats from trees  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZIzJEaIX7U  
- insane sawmill  
 ![insane sawmill]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im4.png")  
- interesting rigid spiral conveyor  
 ![spiral conveyor]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im5.png")  
- planers are great  
- laminate several layers of veneer, bend around steel mold  
 ![bending veneers]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im6.png")  
 ![interesting round shapes]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im7.png")  
- modern take on traditional boat building  
  - these guys do keyed planks for first layer instead of criss-crosses  
veneers  
- stainless staples, fiberglass, absorbative material, vacuum bag  
 ![stainless staples, fiberglass, absorbative material, vacuum  
bag]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-20-Fwd:-`study`-West-System-Cold-Molded-Boa/im8.png")  
- some kinda bondo/clay type juice, plank sanding  
- mark waterline with laser, flipit  
- staple gun is a useful tool  
  
#### Review  
- wood structures are easy to manually mold into the shape you like, but in  
the age of computers strikes me as not the most efficient way to get the  
task done  
  - respect to the artisanalness  
  - useful techniques for something highly aesthetic!

## David Mueller Neural Network Loss Landscape 
### Tuesday, July 19 2022  
https://damueller.com/#/blog-post/NNLLs  
- Why NN's find generalizable solutions?  
  - gradient descent can traverse a complex or simple loss landscape with  
fewer local minima  
  - can't look at all possible weight settings must use GD  
  - skip, residual connections, higher overparameterization, result in  
smoother loss landscapes  
![local minima]("https://monksevillair.com/src/study/2022-07-19-David-Mueller-Neural-Network-Loss-Landscape/im1.png")  
  - NN pref data that is generalizable over random  
- GD Alg ( SGD stochastic gradient descent (into madness))  
  - start @ rand point, move down gradient ideally reducing error  
  - saddle points are a problem: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2572.pdf  
  - gradient descent doesn't often encounter local minima with modern NN  
    - can usually find a global minimizer  
  - GD can be used as universal func approximator  
    - can memorize entire dataset  
- "There is no guarantee that this solution would actually generalize to  
data outside of the training data!"  
  - you  
  
## Wide Basins and Implicit Regularization  
- wide basins are easier to generalize than narrow basin  
  - generalizable NN pref flatter basins  
  - less noise in a flatter basin  
- what is a basin? (basin of attraction)  
  - set of initial points that converge to some attracting set  
  - several points that converge together as the system evolves through time  
  
__left off at Why might SGD prefer basins that are flatter?_
