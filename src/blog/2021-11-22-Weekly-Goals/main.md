Going to start posting some weekly goals here so I'm more inspired to do them!

#### 中文
- [x] Take a Wing Chun class
  - _Wing Chun is a rather relaxing form of martial arts, it focus more on mastering a small number of efficient movements over hundreds of techniques. Truthfully, I chose Wing Chun because I'm completely inspired by the Ip Man Series and Bruce Lee. My hope is to find a school in the Bay Area the primarily teaches Chinese students, so I can make friends and practice my 中文。 Even the first technique I was taught seriously impressed me, running it for a while loosened up my hands a ton and I feel better playing guitar._
- [ ] Do an iTalki class every day
  - _Didn't do it even once!_  

#### 咖啡
- [ ] Order and brew a 5gal batch of cold brew
- [ ] Operate coffee robot 24/7
  - _Didn't do either of these!_  

#### 音乐
- [ ] Learn Misty
  - _Nope!_
- [x] Get a solo set together  
  - _This was the most sucessful part of the week. I was traveling all over California, but I still managed to make this happen, and perform the set with good success! The 12 hours on Amtrak was an extremely good time to focus on putting the set together. Remaining comfortable with performing, even in the face of potential failure and embarrassment resulted in a pretty consistent euphoria. An important element in staying happy is to remain stress free in potentially stressful situations._  

_I hope you have an excellent week, much love_
