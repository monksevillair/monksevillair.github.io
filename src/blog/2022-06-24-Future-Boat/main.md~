I just posted three posts I wrote over the last couple months. They were sitting in my email as I plan to write an email bot to auto-post these when I send them to myself. Should eliminate the friction of opening github, and lets me write from anywhere. I'm also going to write more off-the-cuff, care even less about spelling, because I really want to post stuff and stop caring so much about perfection.  

I designed and 3D printed a catamaran boat mold! Turns out, sailboats are just really heavy, and don't have enough surface area to run solar powered. Even if the boat is completely covered, with solar wings hanging off the edge, the max I could ever get is 10kw. OK for light wind in the Alameda channel, but not even close if you get out in the bay. Though I've puttered around out there on less.  

My search for tri's and cat's was not going very well, and I was sub-happy to learn that many of these boats are overbuilt nonsense, filled with heavy and rediculous furniture. So I've opted to take the hard route and delete the idea of converting some 50's overbuilt cat, and instead increase my fiberglass chops! That's right, one day I'm going to cross an ocean in a homebuilt solar boat baby!  

I decided first to build a scale model. A proper vacuum-bagged hull. I designed and 3D printed a hull (inspired by [RC test flights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFhsh4V8SZA) video), but I'm cheap so I designed a mold that's symetrical on all sides so I can use half the material.

Much sanding, polyester resin, vacuum pump, 2 layers of glass, peel ply... BAM you got a hull. Can't wait to see if it releases from the mold tomorrow!!
