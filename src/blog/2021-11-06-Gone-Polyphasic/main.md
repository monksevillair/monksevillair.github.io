Keeping these blogs short so I do them more often. After a month long experiment, I dropped my Polyphasic sleep schedule. It ultimately concluded after I flew back to honduras, because it was to hot to sleep in my van during the day. 

[Some rather detailed sleep notes!](https://www.monksevillair.com/src/blog/polyphasic/log_edited.html)  

Overall I enjoyed it very much, I was really productive during the night hours and sleeping more made the days feel relaxed. Contradictorily, I did sense my mood decrease and I was less excited about things than I usually am. But being more serious sometimes can be useful I suppose.
