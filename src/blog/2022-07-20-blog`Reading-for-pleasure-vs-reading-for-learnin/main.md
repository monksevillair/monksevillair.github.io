It struck me today after taking my  daily reading notes, that my intentions
of "wanting to read more" are impure. The whole e-reader industry exists
for people who want to read for leisure (black and white screen doesn't
hurt your eyes and keep you awake). What I'm learning is that I really
can't absorb much knowledge without taking notes. And so reading at night,
or on the beach, without thinking about and reinterpreting what I'm reading
is only useful for entertainment. And honestly, I probably prefer watching
interesting movies, although there's something to be said about cultivating
the imagination with a fiction book.

Therefore I think I will clearly separate the things I am studying, from
the things I am consuming for leisure. And there's no reason I can't take
notes on a fiction book either!
