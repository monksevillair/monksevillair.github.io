I've decided to run weekly experiments on things like food, sleep, excersise, and whatever else, in order to develop a lifestyle that can significantly increase my productivity and health.  

There's also something new about the format, I'm going to implement these posts in the form of the scientific method, which will hopefully make things more relevant when evaluating which change was better and which was worse.  

Sometimes, the experiment may take longer than a week, in which case, I'll do a mid week update on the blog post. Just like my Polyphasic blog, I'll have subheadings for the weekly updates in that case.  

This week's experiment you ask? _Let's delete time._ What might it feel like to live in a timeless existence? I've already gone ahead and taped over the clock on my phone, deleted my lockscreen, and removed the clock from my computer, but every once in a while, a new clock unwittingly appears.  

So I'm using Saturday, today, as a "time cheat day" to eliminate the extra clocks and set up a calendar for the week with 1hr warnings before I need to make it to my event. This is a compromise, but it will allow me to not blow off everything in my life immediately. Down the road, I may find alternatives to hard scheduling, and perhaps I can set up or write something like Calendy that allows people to schedule time with me and gives me adequate warning.  

### 为什么/hypothesis
I think there could be stress benefits and improvements in prioritizing living in the moment over living for tomorrow. Having a "time cheat day" may force me to simultaneously think about my life from an objective place, and slice my weeks up to support long term goals.  

### Conclusion (11-21-2021)
This experiment concluded a week ago. The main thing I think that was better was not constantly watching the clock, minute by minute. People use to live by the clock tower- I think some buzzes from your watch to let you know the current hour would yield all the benefits of deleting time, but still make it possible to make appoints. I absolutely ruined my sleep schedule again by running this experiment, but I learned that I naturally will sleep 2hrs later every day. This leads me to next weeks experiment: it's submarine time baby!
