Today I found myself thinking about how much work I've been doing vs how much I feel I've accomplished. I feel like all my personal projects, except for music, are stalling out. I'm taking some time right now to critisize myself do a quick debrief to try to understand why. I also want to lay out a new strategy for finishing more projects. 

#### Contributing Factor 1: Spreading myself too thin
Things I do right now: 3x Classes, music sessions every other day, intermitent subcontracting, personal projects. The misc category of my notebook takes up the most time for some reason, things like getting groceries, coffee, buying food, driving places, meeting new people. I need to set aside some focus time and distraction time.

#### Contributing Factor 2: Lack of Sleep
I've always had a horrible sleep schedule, and have experienced that when I do wake up early I can accomplish much more. I would love to wake up at 8 for the rest of my life, and go to sleep at 12. Being chronically sleep deprived makes me unexcited to do work and counteracting sleep with caffine results in brain fog. This can be mitigated with smaller caffine doses spread throughout the day and by taking breaks and doing pushups :).

#### Contributing Factor 3: Random adventures
I took a week long trip down the 1 in my van, spent some days in slab city, hopped a train. It was dope AF, but let's save the random adventures for the weekend.

#### Possible solutions
- Set aside all projects except the <b>1</b> project I want to focus on for that week
  - Any distracting ideas acknowlege and set make a note for the future
- Come up with a weekly plan and generate a gantt chart from my calendar
  - I need to be sure there are enough hours in the day to accomplish everything
- Self-critisize after completing my daily subtasks
- Set aside the weekends for socializing/random adventures/reading/excersize

#### Projects in the Queue
This is the schedule for my next 3 weeks. I will self-critisize every day on this blog. I will also take the weekends off for socializing/random adventures/reading.
