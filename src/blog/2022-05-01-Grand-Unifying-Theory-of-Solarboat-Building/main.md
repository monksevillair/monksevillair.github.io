Had a little grand unifying theory moment tonight, or should I say this morning ðŸ˜‰, as I write this locked outside of an apartment waiting to follow in the next car that opens garage so I can grab my keys and finally fall asleep.  

Realizing I have a perfectly fine sailboat I'm paying slip fees on, and another wood boat I built a few years ago with a friend from scratch, I came to the conclusion that I should build a 10kw outboard out of the ex-kittyhawk motors I happen to have access to!  

Paired with some 100v batteries, bob's your uncle I've got myself a couple of electric boats and an excellent opportunity for some excersize lugging the outboard around.  

I'm thinking I'll drop the mast on my sailboat, slice it down the middle like a rather elongated sandwich, then cut each piece in half to end up with 4 pieces I can bolt to the deck of the sailboat and lay solar panels on to make a 10kw array.  

Trimaran can wait, I can use this boat as a test platform for the electric power system and as a living space so I can sell my van and aquire a bit of capital to make the project happen!  

That's all for now, someone came out of the garage!
