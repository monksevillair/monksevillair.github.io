Finally feeling like I've learned *how to learn* how to music. Got this
brand new one weird trick coming at you that's actually as old as the hills
but I never really realized how fun it can be.

## Step 0: Acquire the Pure Fire
A highly effective practice only begins by finding some absolute pure fire
that you want to learn. This week I chose my favorite song of all time:
[Never Catch Me by Flying Lotus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lXD0vv-ds8
)

## Step 1: Transcribe that MF!
Now that your pure fire is selected, transcribe it! This took very long
time, very hard. But I know I'm learning because my brain hurts. Still WIP
I want to learn that insane bass solo on the piano at 2:00

Practice the heck out of it!

## Step 2: Transpose your favorite line to all 12 keys

- Figure out the chords so you know how to use it (I like to relate
everything to relative lydian)
- Practice the heck out of it!!
