# Blog - February 20, 2025

A new idea for not getting distracted:  
An experiment. Only use computers at work,  
No screens at home. Instead—use pen  
and paper for everything, including  
writing this blog.

I have many ideas I want to  
experiment with in this domain,  
but it also stems from a dissatisfaction  
about what screens have  
done to my attention.

I am worried I may have never  
fully developed my attention  
mechanism because I was always  
a computer kid, focused on  
doing things/building things with computers.  

I believe this may have started  
what I like to call  
the **"focus director"** in my brain.

My questions will be added  
to my morning paper stack.  
This creates a **#learningfeedbackloop**.

## The Purpose

The purpose of this is to  
create a **daily learning feedback loop**  
that aligns with my long-term goals.  

If there is a PDF in that **/learning** folder,  
it likely is something I want to learn.  

I have not yet figured out  
how to deal with the **over-volume**  
of PDFs, but I'm thinking  
a **simple one** with a  
**daily page-max** parameter should suffice.

## Automating the Blog

There is another idea I  
will present—It is **this very blog**.  
I wrote this blog on paper.  

I will put it in the **scanner, OCR it,**  
and upload it to my website.  

Eventually, this process will  
be fully automatic, and  
I'll have a scanner dedicated to  
this task, labeled **"blog."**  

Each day, I feed the papers  
in there, and the OCR shows  
up on this website.

and **#tags** or **@links** will be clickable.
