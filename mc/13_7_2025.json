        "text": "Interesting find on Neptune Station! While it's a conceptual piece, the focus on community and university collaboration for undersea habitats directly aligns with my interest in hands-on projects and accessible learning environments.  The multimedia aspect hints at potential design and engineering challenges tackled in a creative way, relevant to my broader goal of building an underwater city.",
