        "text": "This MoU between Forum Energy and SAFEEN is a neat example of industry pushing ROV tech forward.  More efficient thrusters directly translate to longer dive times and broader exploration capabilities \u2013 crucial for ambitious projects like undersea volcano research and, eventually, even underwater habitats.  It's a small piece, but part of the bigger puzzle.",
