        "text": "Interesting find! While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program offers invaluable hands-on experience with underwater habitats, a crucial stepping stone for anyone aiming to build an underwater city.  The practical training aspect aligns perfectly with the stated focus on immediate, actionable experience in undersea environments.",

        "text": "This article's mention of lithium hydroxide's CO2-scrubbing capabilities is directly relevant to my interest in closed life support systems for undersea habitats, a critical aspect of building underwater cities.  It highlights a key chemical process for maintaining breathable air in such environments, connecting the seemingly disparate fields of chemistry and underwater construction.",
