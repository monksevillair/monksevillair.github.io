Biofouling is a *massive* problem for any long-term underwater structure, and nanotech solutions like those discussed could be key to making underwater cities even remotely feasible.  This gets to the nitty-gritty of materials science challenges we'll face.",

        "text": "This is fascinating!  Extracting lithium from geothermal brines could be a game-changer for undersea habitats, potentially reducing reliance on surface-based supplies and enabling more self-sufficient, long-term underwater installations.  The intersection of geothermal energy and lithium extraction directly supports my interests in undersea energy generation and life support systems.",

Many of the challenges \u2013 life support, extreme environments, closed-system design \u2013 directly translate to subsea applications.  Worth a read for anyone interested in the broader field of extreme environment habitation.",
