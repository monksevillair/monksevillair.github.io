        "text": "This proceedings document from MIT's Sea Grant College Program offers valuable insights into the early stages of automation in marine engineering. For those interested in underwater habitats and subsea construction, it likely contains foundational concepts and discussions on robotic systems and design automation that are still relevant to modern oceanic projects, including potential applications in volcanic submarine environments.",
