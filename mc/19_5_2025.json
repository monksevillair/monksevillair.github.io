        "text": "This proceedings document from MIT's Sea Grant College Program offers valuable insights into the early stages of automation in marine engineering. For those interested in underwater habitats and subsea construction, it likely contains foundational concepts and discussions on robotic systems and design automation that are still relevant to modern oceanic projects, including potential applications in volcanic submarine environments.",

        "text": "This video demonstrates a practical approach to building a small-scale submersible ROV, which could be invaluable for those interested in underwater city development. The creator's DIY process and use of off-the-shelf components like Seaperch motors offer insights into cost-effective underwater robotics, potentially scaling to larger projects. It's a great example of how independent makers are contributing to subsea exploration technology.",
