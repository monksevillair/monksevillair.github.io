While dated, this Neptune Station project showcases a community-university approach to undersea habitat design \u2013 relevant to my interest in both practical implementation and collaborative learning environments.  The focus on community involvement hints at the broader social and logistical challenges of building and sustaining an underwater city.",

        "text": "Interesting thesis on Li-ion battery degradation!  Directly relevant to my interest in undersea habitats and ROVs \u2013 reliable, long-lasting power sources are critical for these applications, especially in remote locations like underwater volcanoes.  Understanding degradation mechanisms is key to designing more robust and reliable power systems for extended deployments.",
