        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this article on hyperbaric welding is crucial for building and maintaining undersea structures.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and this highlights a critical sub-problem in creating robust, long-lasting underwater habitats.  Understanding these welding techniques is essential for any serious undersea construction project.",
