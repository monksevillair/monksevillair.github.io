        "text": "While not directly about life support *redundancy*, this Red Jacket submersible pump guide is relevant because reliable, redundant pumping systems are *critical* for any undersea habitat or submersible, including those exploring hydrothermal vents like the Lost City.  A failure in fluid management could be catastrophic, highlighting the importance of robust, well-understood technology in these extreme environments.",
