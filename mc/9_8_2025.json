While dated, this Neptune Station concept art highlights the community-university collaboration aspect crucial for undersea habitat development \u2013 exactly the kind of cross-disciplinary approach needed for building future underwater cities.  Shows the long history of thinking about these challenges.",

        "text": "Interesting thesis on Li-ion battery degradation!  Directly relevant to the challenges of long-duration undersea habitats (like Neptune Station) where reliable, long-lasting power is critical.  Understanding degradation mechanisms is key to designing robust energy systems for underwater applications, especially given the harsh conditions.",
