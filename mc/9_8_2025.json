This paper, focusing on bioregenerative life support, directly addresses a critical challenge for any sustained underwater presence, offering a more sustainable alternative to relying solely on resupply missions.  It's a must-read for anyone serious about building self-sufficient undersea environments, complementing discussions about habitat design and energy generation.",
