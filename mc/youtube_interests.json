      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Exploring the synergy between advanced underwater welding techniques, stainless steel applications, and ROV-assisted construction in volcanic subsea environments for resilient underwater habitats. This multidisciplinary approach integrates insights from fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable city design, while addressing engineering challenges in volcanic underwater settings. The study analyzes the economic impacts of tariffs on material costs and supply chains for undersea construction projects, incorporating economic models for seasteading to assess long-term viability. To advance this research, the focus includes active engagement with academic institutions, professional organizations, and local diving groups in the Long Beach area, participating in underwater robotics workshops and connecting with active seasteading groups. This hands-on approach aims to gain practical experience in ROV operations, undersea habitation concepts, and underwater habitat design, while exploring the logistics and economic structures necessary for successful underwater city projects."
