      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Advancing underwater habitat construction through innovative welding techniques and stainless steel applications in volcanic subsea environments, with emphasis on manufacturing large transparent domes for submarines and habitats. This approach integrates ROV-assisted construction methods with insights from fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable underwater city design. The study prioritizes practical underwater habitat projects, investigating the synergy between welding, materials science, and marine biology in harsh volcanic conditions. To advance this research, the focus includes active engagement with academic institutions, diving groups, and underwater robotics workshops in the Long Beach area, participating in hands-on ROV operations and underwater habitat design initiatives. This approach aims to gain practical experience in undersea habitation concepts, construction techniques, and logistical planning for successful underwater city projects, while emphasizing technical implementations and practical solutions for large-scale transparent structures in challenging subsea environments."
