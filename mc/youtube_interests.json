      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Investigating the integration of advanced welding techniques and stainless steel applications in underwater volcanic environments for resilient subsea habitat construction. This study explores the synergy between ROV and underwater robotics technologies with fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable habitat design. It addresses the economic impacts of tariffs on material costs and supply chains, emphasizing the logistical challenges of building in volcanic undersea settings. The research prioritizes engagement with academic and professional groups specializing in undersea habitation, particularly in the Long Beach area, to gain practical knowledge and expand networking opportunities. This approach aims to advance the development of underwater cities through active participation in diving events and groups, fostering connections and hands-on experience. The study synthesizes multidisciplinary aspects including materials science, marine biology, robotics, and economics to progress the vision of inhabitable subsea environments."
