      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: The integration of advanced underwater welding techniques with stainless steel applications in volcanic seafloor environments, now emphasizing the symbiosis between human expertise and robotic capabilities. This study explores the use of underwater robots and ROVs in construction and maintenance near active volcanic zones, while also investigating the incorporation of fish biology and coral ecosystems into habitat design. The research extends to the economic implications of underwater city projects, including the effects of tariffs on materials like stainless steel, and the logistics of creating and maintaining these habitats. There's a growing interest in joining academic and professional groups specializing in underwater habitat design, particularly in the Long Beach area, to further practical knowledge and networking opportunities. This multifaceted approach aims to develop resilient, biologically integrated underwater structures that advance the vision of sustainable underwater cities while addressing economic, logistical, and ecological considerations."
