      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: The integration of advanced underwater welding techniques with stainless steel applications in volcanic seafloor environments, now expanding to include the role of underwater robots and ROVs in construction and maintenance. This exploration examines the synergy between human expertise and robotic capabilities in extreme underwater conditions, particularly near active volcanic zones. The study now incorporates the biological aspects of underwater habitation, investigating how fish biology and coral ecosystems can be integrated into habitat design. Additionally, it explores the potential of joining academic and professional groups specializing in underwater habitat design, with a particular interest in opportunities in the Long Beach area. The research continues to consider the economic implications of such projects, including the effects of tariffs on materials like stainless steel, while also examining the logistics of creating and maintaining these habitats. This multifaceted approach aims to develop resilient, biologically integrated underwater structures, advancing the long-term vision of sustainable underwater cities while considering practical economic, logistical, and ecological factors."
