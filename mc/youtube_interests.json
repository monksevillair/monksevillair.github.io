      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Investigating the integration of advanced underwater welding techniques and stainless steel applications in volcanic subsea environments for resilient underwater habitats. This study combines ROV-assisted construction methods with insights from fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable city design. The research addresses engineering challenges in volcanic underwater settings while analyzing the economic impacts of tariffs on material costs and supply chains for undersea construction projects. To advance this multifaceted approach, the focus includes active engagement with academic institutions, professional organizations, and local diving groups in the Long Beach area, fostering practical knowledge in underwater habitat design and construction. Particular attention is given to participating in relevant diving events, underwater robotics workshops, and connecting with currently active seasteading groups to gain hands-on experience in ROV operations and undersea habitation concepts. Additionally, the research explores economic models and logistics for seasteading to assess the long-term viability and sustainability of underwater city projects, considering the potential effects of tariffs on project feasibility."
