      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Investigating advanced underwater welding techniques and stainless steel applications in volcanic subsea environments for resilient underwater habitats. This approach integrates ROV-assisted construction methods with insights from fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable city design. The study emphasizes practical underwater habitat projects, exploring the integration of welding, materials science, and marine biology in harsh volcanic conditions. To advance this research, the focus includes active engagement with academic institutions, professional organizations, and local diving groups in the Long Beach area, participating in underwater robotics workshops and hands-on ROV operations. This approach aims to gain practical experience in undersea habitation concepts, underwater habitat design, and logistics for successful underwater city projects, while de-emphasizing economic and governmental aspects in favor of technical and practical implementations."
