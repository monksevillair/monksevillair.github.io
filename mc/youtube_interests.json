      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Exploring the synergy between advanced welding techniques, stainless steel applications, and underwater robotics for constructing resilient habitats in volcanic subsea environments. This study integrates fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable underwater city design, while addressing the economic impacts of tariffs on material costs and supply chains. The research emphasizes engagement with academic and professional groups specializing in undersea habitation, particularly in the Long Beach area, to gain practical knowledge and expand networking opportunities. By actively participating in diving events and groups, the study aims to foster connections and hands-on experience in underwater exploration and construction. This multidisciplinary approach combines materials science, marine biology, robotics, and economics to advance the vision of inhabitable subsea environments, with a focus on overcoming logistical challenges in volcanic underwater settings."
