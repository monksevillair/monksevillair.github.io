      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Exploring the intersection of underwater volcanoes, undersea habitation, and ROV technology to advance underwater city design. Investigating innovative construction techniques for large-scale transparent structures in volcanic subsea environments, integrating insights from marine ecosystems. Actively seeking involvement with universities offering ocean engineering programs and participating in underwater habitat design initiatives. Engaging with diving groups, underwater robotics workshops, and attending submersible technology demonstrations to gain practical experience. Expanding knowledge through the study of saturation diving and exploration of underwater habitat projects across the US. This approach aims to synthesize multidisciplinary expertise in welding, materials science, and marine biology to develop sustainable and technologically advanced underwater habitats. Prioritizing hands-on experience with ROVs, submersibles, and underwater construction techniques to inform practical solutions for long-term undersea living."
