      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Exploring the integration of advanced welding techniques and stainless steel applications in volcanic seafloor environments for underwater habitat construction. This study investigates the collaboration between human expertise and ROVs in building and maintaining subsea structures, while incorporating fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics into habitat design. The research extends to the economic and logistical challenges of underwater city projects, including the impact of tariffs on material costs and supply chains. There's an emphasis on joining academic and professional groups specializing in undersea habitation, particularly in the Long Beach area, to gain practical knowledge and expand networking opportunities. This approach aims to develop sustainable underwater structures that advance the vision of inhabitable subsea cities, with a focus on active participation in diving events and groups to gain hands-on experience and foster connections in the field of undersea exploration and construction."
