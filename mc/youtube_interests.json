      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Investigating underwater volcanoes as potential foundations for subsea habitation, integrating advanced ROV and submersible technologies in underwater city design. Exploring innovative construction methods for large-scale structures in volcanic marine environments, while incorporating principles from marine ecosystems. Actively seeking involvement with universities offering specialized ocean engineering programs and participating in underwater habitat design initiatives. Engaging with diving groups, underwater robotics workshops, and attending submersible technology demonstrations for hands-on experience. Expanding knowledge through the study of undersea habitation projects and exploration of diverse underwater environments across the US. This multidisciplinary approach combines expertise in marine geology, robotics, and habitat design to develop sustainable and technologically advanced underwater living spaces. Prioritizing practical experience with ROVs, submersibles, and underwater construction techniques to inform viable solutions for long-term undersea living and advance the vision of a fully-functional underwater city."
