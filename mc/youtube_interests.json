      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Exploring the synergy between advanced underwater welding techniques and stainless steel applications in volcanic subsea environments, with emphasis on ROV-assisted construction of resilient habitats. This study integrates fish biology and coral ecosystem dynamics to inform sustainable city design, while analyzing the economic impacts of tariffs on material costs and supply chains for undersea construction projects. The research prioritizes engagement with academic institutions and professional organizations specializing in underwater habitation, particularly in the Long Beach area, to gain practical knowledge and expand networking opportunities. By actively participating in local diving events and groups, the study aims to foster connections and gain hands-on experience in underwater exploration and construction techniques. This multidisciplinary approach combines materials science, marine biology, robotics, and economics to advance the vision of inhabitable subsea environments, with a focus on overcoming logistical and engineering challenges in volcanic underwater settings."
