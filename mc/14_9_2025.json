        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for building underwater structures.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is key to constructing robust and reliable undersea habitats.  This is a great starting point for anyone interested in the practical engineering of underwater cities.",
