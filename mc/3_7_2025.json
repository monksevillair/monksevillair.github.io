        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is fundamental to building anything substantial underwater, especially for robust, pressure-resistant habitats near active volcanoes.  Shows the level of specialized engineering needed for this kind of project.",
