        "text": "This video showcases a remarkable innovation in underwater technology: small, unmanned submarines with transparent glass hulls. The use of glass for deep-sea exploration vessels addresses key challenges in underwater habitat design, particularly the creation of large transparent structures capable of withstanding extreme pressures. This development could significantly impact future underwater city projects, offering new possibilities for observation modules and even transparent living spaces in subsea environments.",

        "text": "This video offers a fascinating look at the intricate engineering behind nuclear submarine power systems. While not directly about underwater cities, the principles of long-term underwater habitation, life support systems, and power generation in hostile environments are directly applicable to seasteading and subsea habitat design. The reactor shielding techniques could be particularly relevant for developing safe, long-term power solutions in underwater settlements.",
