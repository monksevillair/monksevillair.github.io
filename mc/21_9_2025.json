        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this article on hyperbaric welding is highly relevant to building undersea structures.  The challenges of welding at depth are crucial for constructing robust, pressure-resistant habitats, and understanding these techniques is a key step towards building underwater cities.  This points to the need for specialized materials and processes beyond standard construction.",
