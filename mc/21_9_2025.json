While not specifically addressing underwater applications, this significantly impacts the viability of long-term undersea habitats and ROV deployments, a key consideration for my ongoing work on undersea volcano exploration and habitat design.  Extending battery life this much reduces logistical hurdles and cost, a big win for deep-sea projects.",
