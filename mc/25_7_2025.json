Hyperbaric oxygen therapy's risks are directly relevant to the safety and design of such environments; understanding these risks is crucial for creating effective life support systems.  The RationalWiki article provides a good starting point for researching potential dangers and necessary safety protocols.",

This RO membrane work could inform the design of life support systems, especially given today's other discussion on hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its potential challenges.  Minimizing biofouling on crucial systems is key for any sustained underwater presence.",
