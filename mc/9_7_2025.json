While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, the advanced training program hints at the practical, hands-on experience needed for undersea habitat work \u2013 exactly what I'm hunting for.  Looks like a good lead for networking and potentially getting involved in relevant projects.",

        "text": "This article's mention of lithium hydroxide's CO2-scrubbing capabilities is directly relevant to my interest in closed-loop life support systems for undersea habitats.  It highlights a critical component for long-duration underwater missions, connecting the seemingly disparate fields of chemistry and subsea exploration.  Given today's discussion on Aquarius habitat training, this reinforces the importance of reliable life support technology for extended underwater stays.",
