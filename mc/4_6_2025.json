        "text": "This symposium proceedings from 1968 is a goldmine for underwater habitat enthusiasts. It covers deep submergence vehicle development, navigation systems, and subsystem costs for deep ocean systems - all crucial for underwater city planning. The inclusion of topics like turbulent free convection and marine anchor holding capacity in sand demonstrates the multidisciplinary approach needed for subsea construction.",
