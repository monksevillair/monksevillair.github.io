While not directly addressing underwater *operation*, this significantly impacts the viability of long-term undersea habitats and ROV deployments \u2013 a huge factor for my ongoing projects exploring underwater volcanoes and habitat design.  Suddenly, battery replacement becomes a much less frequent headache.",
