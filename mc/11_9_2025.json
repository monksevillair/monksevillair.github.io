While it doesn't directly address underwater construction, the discussion of extreme environments and material science for habitats in space could offer valuable insights for designing structures that withstand immense pressure, relevant to my interest in underwater cities.  Perhaps the challenges of radiation shielding in space have parallels to managing pressure in deep-sea environments?",
