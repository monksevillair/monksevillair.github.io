Hyperbaric welding is crucial for deep-sea construction, exactly the kind of niche skill needed for building underwater habitats or even an underwater volcano research station.  This article shows the kind of specialized facilities and expertise that will be essential for such projects.",

        "text": "Interesting article on biofouling in floating wind farms \u2013 a crucial consideration for any large-scale underwater infrastructure, including my eventual underwater city!  While not directly related to volcanoes, the biofouling challenge highlights the need for robust, long-term materials and mitigation strategies in marine environments, something crucial for both wind farms and subsea habitats.",
