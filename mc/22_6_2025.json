        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real-world underwater habitat?  That's way more valuable than any theoretical paper.  This is where the rubber meets the road for aspiring underwater city builders.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 this paper's focus on RO membranes is relevant to long-term undersea habitat sustainability.  Keeping those membranes clean is critical for water recycling in a closed environment, and nanoparticle/polymer solutions could be key to minimizing maintenance in underwater habitats.  This complements the Aquarius training post by highlighting a crucial engineering challenge for extended undersea missions.",
