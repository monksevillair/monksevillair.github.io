This highlights the need to explore alternative battery chemistries and resource management strategies for sustainable underwater cities.  The report's open access is a plus for anyone tackling this problem set.",

        "text": "Interesting choice of material for antifouling \u2013 TiO2-based enamel.  While not directly related to volcano exploration, this is crucial for long-term undersea habitat viability; biofouling is a huge problem for any submerged structure, and this could be a key component in making habitats like Neptune Station actually work.  The corrosion resistance aspect is also a big plus for undersea energy generation.",
