While not directly related to volcano exploration, this is crucial for long-term undersea habitat viability; biofouling is a huge problem for any submerged structure, and this could be a key component in making habitats like Neptune Station actually work.  The corrosion resistance aspect is also a big plus for undersea energy generation.",
