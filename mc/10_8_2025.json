        "text": "Interesting IRENA report on lithium \u2013 crucial for energy storage, which is a *massive* challenge for any long-term undersea habitat (like Neptune Station!).  This highlights the need to explore alternative battery chemistries and resource management strategies for sustainable underwater cities.  The report's open access is a plus for anyone tackling this problem set.",
