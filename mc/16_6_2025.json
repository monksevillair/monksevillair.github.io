        "text": "Interesting find on Aquarius!  While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, the advanced training program highlights the practical, hands-on experience crucial for undersea habitat work \u2013 exactly what I'm looking for in bridging theory to real-world application.  This could be a great stepping stone for getting involved in US-based projects.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 focusing on RO membranes is relevant to long-term undersea habitat sustainability.  While not directly about volcano exploration, mitigating biofouling on water filtration systems is crucial for closed-loop life support in underwater habitats, tying into the Aquarius training post and my broader interest in undersea living.",
