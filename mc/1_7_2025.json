This paper's focus on membrane tech for RO, while seemingly niche, speaks to the broader challenge of maintaining clean surfaces in harsh marine environments, impacting everything from habitat life support to submersible sensor performance.  Relevant to the discussions on hyperbaric habitats and submersibles today.",
