        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this article on hyperbaric welding is crucial for undersea construction.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is vital for building anything substantial underwater, from habitats to ROVs.  This is a great starting point for understanding the practical engineering hurdles of underwater projects.",
