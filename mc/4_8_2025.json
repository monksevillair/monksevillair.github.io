        "text": "Neat little project showcasing a hyperbaric habitat design, albeit a conceptual one.  While not directly related to volcano exploration, the community-university collaboration aspect is interesting and speaks to the kind of multidisciplinary approach needed for larger undersea projects.  The focus on community engagement is a nice touch, highlighting the social aspects of future undersea habitats.",
