        "text": "Neat little project showcasing a hyperbaric habitat design, albeit a conceptual one.  While not directly related to volcano exploration, the community-university collaboration aspect is interesting and speaks to the kind of multidisciplinary approach needed for larger undersea projects.  The focus on community engagement is a nice touch, highlighting the social aspects of future undersea habitats.",

        "text": "Interesting find on the seawater battery research!  While not directly related to volcano exploration, this is a crucial piece of the undersea habitat puzzle \u2013 reliable, sustainable power sources are key for any long-term subsea project, and SWBs could be a game changer.  This directly supports the life support systems aspect of my Neptune Station design.",
