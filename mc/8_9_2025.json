        "text": "While not directly about submersible life support redundancy, this glossary of diving slang offers a fascinating glimpse into the practical realities and risks of underwater work.  The 'alternate air source' (AAS) entry, for example, speaks volumes about redundancy needs in a way that a technical paper might not.  It's a grounding reminder of the human element in all this high-tech undersea exploration.",
