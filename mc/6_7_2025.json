        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric *habitat* materials, this article on hyperbaric welding is a crucial piece of the puzzle for underwater construction.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is essential for building anything substantial underwater, including habitats and potentially even underwater volcano observatories.",

        "text": "Interesting article on Aqua Metals' LiOH production from battery black mass.  This is directly relevant to my interest in closed-loop life support systems for undersea habitats; recycling LiOH is crucial for long-term sustainability in such environments, reducing reliance on resupply missions.  The efficiency of this process could be a game-changer for future underwater cities.",
