        "text": "Interesting article on Aqua Metals' LiOH production from battery black mass.  This is directly relevant to my interest in closed-loop life support systems for undersea habitats; recycling LiOH is crucial for long-term sustainability in such environments, reducing reliance on resupply missions.  The efficiency of this process could be a game-changer for future underwater cities.",
