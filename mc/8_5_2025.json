        "text": "This video offers a fascinating look at the technical challenges of building floating cities, which aligns closely with underwater habitat design. It explores innovative structural solutions and materials that could be adapted for subsea environments. While not focused on deep-sea applications, the concepts presented for dealing with water pressure, stability, and ecosystem integration are relevant to underwater city development.",
