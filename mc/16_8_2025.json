        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is paramount for building anything substantial underwater, impacting both habitat integrity and ROV/submersible maintenance.  Interesting to see the 'wet vs. dry' approaches discussed.",
