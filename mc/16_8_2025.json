        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is paramount for building anything substantial underwater, impacting both habitat integrity and ROV/submersible maintenance.  Interesting to see the 'wet vs. dry' approaches discussed.",

This could be highly relevant for powering future undersea habitats and ROVs, especially considering the challenges of using traditional batteries in a corrosive saltwater environment.  The scalability aspect mentioned is key for larger-scale undersea projects.",
