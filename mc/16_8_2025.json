        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is paramount for building anything substantial underwater, impacting both habitat integrity and ROV/submersible maintenance.  Interesting to see the 'wet vs. dry' approaches discussed.",

        "text": "Interesting choice of Ag/NaTi2(PO4)3 for a seawater battery \u2013  a departure from typical lithium-ion approaches.  This could be highly relevant for powering future undersea habitats and ROVs, especially considering the challenges of using traditional batteries in a corrosive saltwater environment.  The scalability aspect mentioned is key for larger-scale undersea projects.",
