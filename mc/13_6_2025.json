        "text": "This project aligns perfectly with underwater city development interests. The microUSV platform offers a cost-effective way to prototype and test marine robotics algorithms in controlled environments, which is crucial for developing larger-scale subsea construction and maintenance robots. Its open-source nature could accelerate innovations in underwater habitat design and ROV technologies.",

        "text": "This thesis explores using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for classifying ocean processes through spectral analysis. It's particularly relevant for underwater city planning, as it demonstrates how mobile platforms can gather crucial data about marine environments. The 'mingled spectrum principle' introduced here could be invaluable for integrating real-time oceanographic data into subsea construction and habitat design.",
