        "text": "This project aligns perfectly with underwater city development interests. The microUSV platform offers a cost-effective way to prototype and test marine robotics algorithms in controlled environments, which is crucial for developing larger-scale subsea construction and maintenance robots. Its open-source nature could accelerate innovations in underwater habitat design and ROV technologies.",
