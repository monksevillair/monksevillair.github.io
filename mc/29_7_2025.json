        "text": "Interesting paper on microbial community differentiation in Lost City hydrothermal vents.  This is directly relevant to understanding the unique ecosystems we'd need to consider when designing undersea habitats, especially near volcanically active areas.  The habitat heterogeneity highlighted suggests complex engineering challenges and opportunities for bio-inspired design in future undersea cities.",
