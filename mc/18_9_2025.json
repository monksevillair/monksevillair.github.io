        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this article on hyperbaric welding is highly relevant to undersea habitat construction.  The challenges of welding at depth are crucial for building robust, pressure-resistant structures, and this offers a practical, albeit niche, engineering perspective on that process.  Understanding these techniques is essential for anyone serious about building underwater habitats.",

        "text": "Interesting article on biofouling in floating wind farms.  While seemingly unrelated to underwater volcanoes or habitats at first glance, the biofouling challenge highlights a critical design constraint for *any* long-term submerged structure \u2013 including undersea cities.  Solving biofouling is key to the longevity and efficiency of anything we build in the ocean, and this article offers valuable insights into mitigation strategies.",
