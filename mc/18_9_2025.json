        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this article on hyperbaric welding is highly relevant to undersea habitat construction.  The challenges of welding at depth are crucial for building robust, pressure-resistant structures, and this offers a practical, albeit niche, engineering perspective on that process.  Understanding these techniques is essential for anyone serious about building underwater habitats.",
