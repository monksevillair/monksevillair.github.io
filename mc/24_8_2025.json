        "text": "While not directly about life support redundancy in submersibles, this glossary of diving slang offers a fascinating glimpse into the practical, human side of underwater operations.  The jargon highlights the inherent risks and the crucial role of backup systems, implicitly underscoring the importance of redundancy in life support \u2013 a point often overlooked in the more theoretical discussions of habitat design and technology.  It's a reminder that even with advanced tech, human ingenuity and reliable communication remain paramount.",
