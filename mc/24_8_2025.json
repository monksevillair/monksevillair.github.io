        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is paramount for building anything substantial underwater, and this gives a good overview of the challenges involved.  Definitely relevant to anyone planning an underwater city!",
