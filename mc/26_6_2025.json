        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitats.  Getting hands-on experience in a real-world, operational habitat like Aquarius is invaluable, offering practical skills directly applicable to future undersea city design.  Think of it as a crucial stepping stone on the path to building that underwater metropolis.",
