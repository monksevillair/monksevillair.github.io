        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitats.  Getting hands-on experience in a real-world, operational habitat like Aquarius is invaluable, offering practical skills directly applicable to future undersea city design.  Think of it as a crucial stepping stone on the path to building that underwater metropolis.",

        "text": "Interesting NASA pivot using subsea volcanoes as an analog for space exploration!  This directly relates to my interest in undersea habitats and ROVs, highlighting the transferable skills and challenges between these seemingly disparate fields.  The article's focus on extreme environments makes it a valuable resource for anyone looking at the design and operation of future underwater cities.",
