        "text": "This technical report addresses a critical gap in underwater habitat design, exploring the elastic properties of toroidal shells for submarine pressure hulls. It's particularly relevant for innovative underwater city concepts, as toroidal structures could offer unique advantages in subsea construction. The analysis methods presented here could be adapted for designing large-scale habitats capable of withstanding deep-sea pressures, bridging theoretical naval engineering with practical applications in underwater architecture.",

        "text": "This video explores the concept of floating cities as a response to rising sea levels, which aligns with underwater habitation interests. While not directly about subsea living, it discusses crucial challenges in marine structural engineering and sustainable aquatic urban design. The analysis of real-world prototypes and their technical hurdles could provide valuable insights for underwater city projects.",

        "text": "This video offers a fascinating deep dive into the engineering challenges of seasteading, specifically addressing wave mitigation through floating breakwaters. The integration of wave power generators adds an interesting sustainability angle, potentially solving two critical issues for underwater habitation: protection from harsh ocean conditions and renewable energy generation. It's a great example of the multidisciplinary approach needed for large-scale underwater projects.",
