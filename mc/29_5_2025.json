        "text": "This technical report addresses a critical gap in underwater habitat design, exploring the elastic properties of toroidal shells for submarine pressure hulls. It's particularly relevant for innovative underwater city concepts, as toroidal structures could offer unique advantages in subsea construction. The analysis methods presented here could be adapted for designing large-scale habitats capable of withstanding deep-sea pressures, bridging theoretical naval engineering with practical applications in underwater architecture.",
