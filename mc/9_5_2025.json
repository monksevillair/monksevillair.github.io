While not directly about habitat *construction*, understanding the complex biofilm ecosystems is crucial for designing sustainable, integrated deep-sea habitats \u2013  we need to know what we're building *around* before we build *in* it.  This directly supports the long-term goal of creating a thriving underwater city.",
