        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is essential for building anything substantial underwater, and this gives some insight into the challenges involved.  Definitely relevant to anyone thinking about building undersea habitats or exploring underwater volcanoes.",

        "text": "Interesting article, especially given my focus on undersea habitats.  Biofouling is a massive challenge for any long-term underwater structure, from floating wind farms to, you know, underwater cities.  This highlights the need for robust materials and proactive mitigation strategies in the design phase \u2013 something crucial for both the wind farm context and my more ambitious underwater habitat goals.",
