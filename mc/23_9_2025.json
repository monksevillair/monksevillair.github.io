        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the undersea construction puzzle.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is essential for building anything substantial underwater, and this gives some insight into the challenges involved.  Definitely relevant to anyone thinking about building undersea habitats or exploring underwater volcanoes.",
