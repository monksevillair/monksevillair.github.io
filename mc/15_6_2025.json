        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Getting hands-on experience in a real-world underwater habitat like Aquarius is invaluable, providing practical skills and connections crucial for future undersea city projects.  Shows a clear path to practical experience in a relevant field.",

        "text": "Interesting read on biofouling mitigation for RO membranes \u2013 relevant because maintaining clean surfaces is *critical* for long-term underwater habitats and ROVs.  This nanoparticle/polymer brush approach could be a game-changer for extending the lifespan of equipment in harsh marine environments, directly impacting the feasibility of sustained undersea operations like those near underwater volcanoes.",
