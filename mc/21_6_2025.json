        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013  while not directly about habitats, this paper's focus on nanoparticle and polymer brush modification for RO membranes is highly relevant to long-term undersea habitation.  Keeping those RO systems clean in a harsh marine environment is critical for a sustainable underwater city, so this is a foundational material science problem.",
