Keeping those RO systems clean in a harsh marine environment is critical for a sustainable underwater city, so this is a foundational material science problem.",

The Aberdeen facility mentioned is a potential resource, and the focus on diver welders highlights the specialized skills needed for subsea construction, tying in nicely with today's other discussions on underwater habitats and volcanic exploration.",
