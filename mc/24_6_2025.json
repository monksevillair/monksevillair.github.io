        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real, operational habitat is invaluable, offering a practical grounding rarely found in academic settings.  This is exactly the kind of direct experience I'm looking for to bridge theory and practice in my underwater city ambitions.",
