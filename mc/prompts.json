      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus:  Research and development of underwater habitats and ROVs for volcano exploration, with a strong emphasis on stainless steel welding techniques and the logistical/economic impact of tariffs on materials.  Specific research interests center on hydrothermal vent ecosystems, focusing on fish and coral biology within these environments.  This involves actively seeking and joining relevant research groups and diving communities in the Long Beach area, leveraging and further developing skills in stainless steel fabrication and welding.  Current activities include intensive stainless steel welding practice, detailed research into tariff impacts on relevant materials, and actively networking with Long Beach diving and research groups specializing in underwater volcanoes, ROVs, and hydrothermal vent ecosystems.  Immediate priorities are enhancing welding proficiency, completing tariff impact analysis, and securing memberships in relevant Long Beach-based diving and research organizations."
