      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Hands-on participation in Long Beach-based projects related to underwater volcano habitat development, specifically focusing on the design and manufacturing of large transparent stainless steel domes for underwater habitats and submarines.  Key interests include welding stainless steel, ROV technology and operation in deep-sea volcanic environments, fish and coral biology relevant to deep-sea construction, and the logistics of deep-sea construction. This involves identifying and joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities, and participating in local diving events and seasteading groups focused on underwater habitats.  The priority is direct, practical involvement in underwater volcano habitat projects; economic and governmental considerations are secondary.  This includes exploring welding techniques for stainless steel, researching ROV applications in deep-sea volcanic environments, and investigating fish and coral species relevant to deep-sea habitat construction. The goal is to actively engage with Long Beach-based groups and universities to find opportunities for hands-on involvement in underwater habitat design and construction."
