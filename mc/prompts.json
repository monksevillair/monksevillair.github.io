      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs, and submersibles, prioritizing immediate practical application and focused networking.  Emphasis on US-based opportunities.\n\nKey Interests: Identifying and joining groups and universities involved in underwater habitat design, ROV technologies, submersible operation, and ocean engineering; attending relevant US-based meetups and scuba events offering practical experience and networking opportunities; researching and directly contacting universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources related to underwater volcanology and submersible technology.  Focus on direct engagement and hands-on skill development.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Researching and applying to universities offering hands-on experience with ROVs, submersibles, and underwater habitat design; identifying and contacting organizations focused on underwater volcano research and ROV/submersible technologies; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups for networking and practical experience.  Direct outreach to identified universities and organizations is crucial.\n\nResearch Priorities: ROV and submersible applications in deep-sea volcanic environments; design and construction of underwater habitats; practical aspects of submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying and directly contacting relevant university personnel and securing hands-on opportunities.  Focus remains on immediate, practical application and skill acquisition within the context of underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs, and submersibles.\n\nFurther Exploration: Locating and contacting relevant diving, technical, and academic event organizers across the US; actively pursuing hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles through university programs, organizational affiliations, and volunteer opportunities.  Prioritizing immediate, practical experience and collaborative opportunities in underwater volcano research, undersea habitation, and ROV technology."
