      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Deep-sea exploration and habitat development, with a strong emphasis on the logistical challenges and economic considerations involved. This involves researching and developing ROV technology, mastering stainless steel welding and fabrication, and analyzing the economic impact of tariffs on relevant materials.  Key biological interests include fish and coral within hydrothermal vent ecosystems near underwater volcanoes. Current activities center on improving stainless steel welding skills, completing tariff impact analysis, and actively networking with Long Beach-based diving communities and research groups specializing in underwater robotics, volcano research, and deep-sea biology to identify opportunities for collaboration and participation in relevant diving events and university/group affiliations. Immediate priorities are enhancing welding proficiency, completing tariff analysis, and securing memberships within relevant Long Beach organizations."
