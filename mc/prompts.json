      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "My current research focus is on the intersection of welding stainless steel and underwater volcano exploration, specifically examining the logistical challenges of transporting and deploying materials in this extreme environment and the economic impact of tariffs on project costs.  This research prioritizes a practical understanding of welding techniques applicable to underwater construction, the material science of stainless steel under high pressure and temperature, and the economic and logistical factors influencing project feasibility."
