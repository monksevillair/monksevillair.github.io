      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate engagement with US-based underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles), prioritizing hands-on experience. Key Interests: Identifying and connecting with US-based universities and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design and submersible technology; locating and participating in relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; researching and applying to universities offering ocean engineering programs related to underwater volcanology; securing practical experience in ROV/submersible operation and maintenance. Goal: Secure participation in active US-based projects related to underwater volcanoes, habitats, and ROV/submersible technology within university groups or industry settings; emphasizing immediate, hands-on involvement.  Finding and joining active project teams remains the paramount goal.  Current search focus:  US universities with strong ocean engineering programs and relevant research groups focusing on underwater volcanology, habitat design, and submersible technology; US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater exploration."
