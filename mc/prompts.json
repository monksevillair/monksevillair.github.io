      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on participation in Long Beach-based underwater habitat projects, specifically the design and fabrication of large transparent stainless steel domes for submersibles.  Key interests: Welding stainless steel, underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, fish and coral biology, ROV technology and operation, the logistics of deep-sea construction, submersible operation, and the manufacturing process of large transparent domes. Immediate priorities:  Gaining practical welding skills, researching deep-sea volcanic environments, and identifying and joining Long Beach organizations involved in underwater robotics and habitat construction. Research priorities: ROV applications in deep-sea volcanic environments, relevant fish and coral species, and saturation diving techniques. This involves identifying and joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities offering practical experience in stainless steel welding and fabrication, participating in local diving events and groups focused on underwater habitats, and attending trade shows showcasing submarine and underwater technology. Further exploration: Identifying universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources, attending relevant diving events and groups in the Long Beach area, and seeking out videos and anecdotes of saturation diving.  The focus is on the practical, hands-on technical aspects of underwater habitat construction within the Long Beach area, particularly welding, stainless steel fabrication, ROV deployment in deep-sea volcanic environments, and the design and manufacture of large transparent domes.  The goal is hands-on experience in underwater habitat design and construction through local California organizations and universities. Economic and governmental considerations are secondary."
