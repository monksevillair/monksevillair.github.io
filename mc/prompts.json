      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on involvement in underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, and related technologies, as directly reflected in my recently noted interests. Key Interests: Underwater volcanoes; undersea habitation; underwater robots (ROVs) and submersibles; universities with strong ocean engineering programs and relevant research; Florida-based meetups and scuba diving events; life support systems (including lithium hydroxide and alternatives); undersea energy generation. Goal: Secure immediate, practical experience in university or industry settings related to these interests, prioritizing opportunities for direct project involvement and team collaboration. Current search focus: Universities and research groups actively involved in underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, ROV/submersible technology, and undersea energy generation; relevant Florida-based meetups, scuba diving events, and organizations; opportunities for immediate, hands-on project participation and collaborative team experiences. Emphasis on readily accessible projects and collaborative learning environments directly related to underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs, submersibles, and undersea energy generation. Immediate action items include researching and contacting relevant universities, organizations, and groups, and actively seeking opportunities for immediate participation in hands-on projects and collaborative teams. This profile prioritizes actively pursuing opportunities for direct, hands-on engagement with underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, ROV/submersible technology, and undersea energy generation.  The primary focus is on immediate, practical experience gained through active participation in relevant projects and communities."
