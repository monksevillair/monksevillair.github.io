      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on involvement in underwater habitat design and construction, specifically focusing on submersible technology and ROV deployment in deep-sea volcanic environments. Key Interests: Underwater volcanoes, undersea habitation, underwater robots/ROVs, submersibles, universities with strong ocean engineering programs, and relevant groups/organizations for practical experience. Immediate Priorities: Identifying and joining relevant universities and organizations offering opportunities in underwater habitat design and ROV operation, participating in local and national diving/scuba events, and researching universities with strong ocean engineering programs. Research Priorities: ROV applications in deep-sea volcanic environments, design and construction of underwater habitats, and the operational logistics of submersibles. Further Exploration: Investigating universities with ocean engineering programs, attending relevant diving and technical events across the US, and exploring opportunities for hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles. The focus is on gaining practical experience through participation in relevant organizations and educational programs, emphasizing hands-on learning and collaboration.  Economic and governmental considerations are secondary."
