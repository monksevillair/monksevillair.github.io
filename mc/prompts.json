      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Deep-sea habitat development near Long Beach's underwater volcanoes, emphasizing practical application within active seasteading communities.  This involves mastering stainless steel welding, analyzing the economic effects of tariffs on relevant materials, and researching ROV technology for deep-sea exploration and construction in volcanic environments.  Research priorities include the biological impact of deep-sea construction on fish and coral ecosystems and the logistical challenges of deep-sea construction projects, incorporating sustainable seasteading economic models.  Activities will focus on: improving stainless steel welding proficiency; completing tariff analysis; sourcing stainless steel; joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics; and participating in interesting diving events and active seasteading groups in the Long Beach area.  Immediate priorities are: enhancing welding skills (stainless steel); finalizing tariff analysis; sourcing stainless steel; identifying and joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities; participating in relevant diving events and seasteading groups; and researching the biological impact of deep-sea construction.  Emphasis is on practical, hands-on experience in stainless steel welding and ROV operation, and understanding the logistical and economic aspects of deep-sea construction, informed by research into the economic effects of tariffs and sustainable seasteading models.  Specific areas of focus include: the biology of fish and coral impacted by deep-sea construction, logistics of deep-sea construction projects, economic models for sustainable seasteading communities, and identification and engagement with relevant Long Beach organizations and active seasteading groups."
