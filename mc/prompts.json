      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Securing immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, and underwater robots (ROVs and submersibles) in the US, emphasizing practical application and direct engagement.  Priority is given to identifying and joining relevant US-based groups and universities offering active programs and training opportunities.\n\nKey Interests:  US universities with strong ocean engineering programs and active research in underwater volcanology, undersea habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology;  US-based meetups and scuba events related to underwater robotics and habitats;  identifying and connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in these fields; locating and accessing resources (courses, workshops, internships) at US universities relevant to underwater volcanology and submersible technology.  Focus is on practical training and direct involvement.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and applying to relevant US university programs offering hands-on experience; directly contacting US-based organizations conducting research in underwater volcanology, undersea habitats, and ROV/submersible technology; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups; seeking mentorship and collaboration opportunities with experts.\n\nResearch Priorities:  ROV and submersible applications in deep-sea volcanic environments; the design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; practical submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations offering hands-on experience.  Emphasis is on practical, immediate training and participation."
