      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Securing immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles) in the US.  Emphasis on readily available opportunities and direct project involvement.\n\nKey Interests:  US universities with strong ocean engineering programs relevant to underwater volcanology, undersea habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology; US-based meetups and scuba events related to underwater robotics, habitats, and volcanology;  identifying and connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design, submersible operation, and underwater volcano exploration; securing practical training and participation (courses, workshops, internships, volunteer positions, or shadowing opportunities) within US-based groups and projects.\n\nImmediate Priorities:  Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations offering hands-on experience in underwater habitat design, ROV/submersible operation, or underwater volcanology; researching and applying to relevant university programs and initiatives; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups to network and discover opportunities; proactively seeking out groups focused on underwater habitat design.\n\nResearch Priorities:  Practical applications of ROVs and submersibles in deep-sea volcanic environments; the design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; practical submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations with immediate hands-on participation opportunities. Focus on readily accessible avenues for direct project involvement."
