      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate engagement with underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, submersibles, ROVs, and undersea energy generation, focusing on Florida-based opportunities. Key Interests: Identifying and joining Florida-based universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources relevant to these areas; participating in relevant Florida-based meetups and scuba diving events; researching life support systems, particularly lithium hydroxide applications. Goal: Secure hands-on experience in university or industry settings related to underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, ROV/submersible technologies, undersea energy generation, and life support systems. Current search focus: Florida universities offering relevant ocean engineering programs; Florida-based meetups and scuba diving events; research projects and teams in Florida actively working on underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitats, ROV/submersible technologies, undersea energy generation, and life support systems; opportunities for immediate, hands-on participation in active projects and collaborative groups in Florida. Emphasis on readily accessible projects and collaborative learning environments directly related to underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs, submersibles, undersea energy generation, and life support systems within Florida. Immediate action items include researching and contacting relevant universities, organizations, and groups focused on these areas in Florida, and actively seeking out opportunities for immediate participation in hands-on projects and collaborative teams. This profile prioritizes actively pursuing opportunities for direct, hands-on engagement with underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, ROV/submersible technology, undersea energy generation, and life support systems, and related communities in Florida. The primary focus is on readily accessible opportunities for immediate involvement in active projects and related university programs and events, specifically within Florida."
