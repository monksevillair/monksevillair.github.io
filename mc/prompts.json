      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Securing immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, submersibles, ROVs, and related ocean engineering programs in the US.  Priority is given to identifying and joining relevant groups and university programs.\n\nKey Interests: US universities and organizations offering programs and projects in underwater volcanology, undersea habitat design, submersible operation, and ROV deployment.  Specific focus on opportunities for direct participation in hands-on projects.  Relevant US-based meetups and scuba events offering networking and skill-building opportunities in these areas.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting relevant US universities and organizations; attending relevant meetups and scuba events; connecting with individuals and groups involved in underwater habitat design, submersible operation, ROV deployment, and underwater volcanology; securing immediate hands-on project involvement.\n\nResearch Priorities:  Hands-on experience with submersibles and ROVs; practical applications of ROVs in underwater volcanic environments; design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations offering immediate, hands-on participation opportunities.  Emphasis on readily accessible avenues for direct project involvement and skill acquisition."
