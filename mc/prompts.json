      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Hands-on participation in Long Beach-based projects related to underwater volcano habitat development, prioritizing practical skills acquisition and direct project involvement. Key interests include stainless steel welding, ROV technology and operation for deep-sea volcanic construction, joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities, participating in local diving events and seasteading groups, researching the biological impact (fish and coral) and logistical challenges of deep-sea construction, and researching the design and manufacturing of large transparent domes for underwater habitats.  Focus is strongly on technical skills development and practical project experience; economic and governmental aspects are excluded.  Specific current interests include logistics of deep-sea construction and the welding of stainless steel for underwater applications."
