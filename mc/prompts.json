      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Gaining immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, underwater robots (especially ROVs), and submersibles.  This involves identifying and joining relevant US-based universities, groups, and events.\n\nKey Interests: US universities and organizations with strong ocean engineering programs and active underwater habitat design projects;  US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater robotics or exploration; opportunities for hands-on project involvement in building, deploying, or operating underwater robots or submersibles, particularly in volcanic environments; information on specific universities and groups working on underwater habitat projects, ROV deployments, and volcanic exploration.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations offering immediate hands-on experience in underwater robotics, habitat design, or submersible operation; attending relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; connecting with individuals and groups working with underwater robots, submersibles, and undersea habitats; securing immediate, hands-on project involvement in underwater habitat design or related projects.  Finding and joining relevant groups and universities is paramount.\n\nResearch Priorities: Hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles in volcanic environments; practical applications of underwater robotics in volcanic exploration and habitat maintenance; design and construction of undersea habitats; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities offering immediate, hands-on participation in habitat design or related projects; information about specific universities and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design, ROV operation, and volcanic exploration. Focus on readily accessible avenues for direct project involvement and skill acquisition related to underwater robotics, habitat technologies, and volcanic exploration.  Emphasis on leveraging university resources and group participation for project involvement."
