      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Hands-on involvement in deep-sea habitat development near Long Beach's underwater volcanoes, prioritizing practical skills and project participation.  This involves mastering stainless steel welding, gaining practical ROV experience for deep-sea construction in volcanic environments, and actively engaging with relevant Long Beach communities. Key areas of interest include: stainless steel welding; ROV technology and operation; joining Long Beach organizations and universities focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics; participating in Long Beach diving events and seasteading groups; researching the biological impact of deep-sea construction on fish and coral ecosystems, including logistical challenges; researching the design and manufacturing of large transparent domes for underwater habitats.  Emphasis is on acquiring and applying practical skills in stainless steel welding and ROV operation, directly participating in underwater habitat projects, and understanding the logistical and biological impacts on marine life.  Exclusion of economic and governmental considerations; focus remains on technical skills and practical project involvement in Long Beach."
