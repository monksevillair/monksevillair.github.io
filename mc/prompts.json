      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate involvement in US-based underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles), prioritizing hands-on experience.  This focus is driven by recently discovered interests.\n\nKey Interests:  US universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources relevant to underwater volcano exploration, ROV/submersible operation, and undersea habitat design; US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater robotics, exploration, or volcanic environments; opportunities for immediate participation in projects involving the building, deployment, or operation of underwater robots or submersibles, particularly near volcanic environments; identifying and connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design, ROV/submersible operation, and underwater volcano research; finding and joining groups and universities actively involved in these areas.  Immediate project involvement is paramount. Emphasis on practical, hands-on experience.  Specific interest in identifying relevant groups and universities for collaboration and participation.\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations offering immediate hands-on experience in underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitat design, ROV operation, or submersible operation; attending relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; securing immediate, hands-on project involvement in habitat design or ROV/submersible operation near underwater volcanoes; joining relevant US-based groups and universities actively researching and working with underwater volcanoes, habitats, and robotics."
