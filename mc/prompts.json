      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Gaining immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles) in the US.  Priority is on readily accessible opportunities for direct project involvement, leveraging recently identified resources.\n\nKey Interests:  US universities and organizations offering practical training and participation (courses, workshops, internships, volunteer positions, or shadowing) in underwater habitat design, submersible operation, and underwater volcanology; US-based meetups and scuba events related to underwater robotics, habitats, and volcanology; identifying and connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in these fields.\n\nImmediate Priorities:  Researching and contacting US universities and organizations with relevant ocean engineering programs and active projects; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups to network and discover opportunities; proactively seeking out groups focused on underwater habitat design and submersible operation.\n\nResearch Priorities:  Practical applications of ROVs and submersibles in deep-sea volcanic environments; the design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; hands-on submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations offering immediate hands-on participation.  Focus on readily accessible avenues for direct project involvement."
