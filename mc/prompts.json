      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Securing immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, underwater robots (ROVs and submersibles), and related US-based university and group projects.  Priority is direct project involvement, particularly in ROV/submersible operation and habitat design.  Focus is on identifying and joining specific US-based groups and universities offering immediate opportunities, as evidenced by recent interests.\n\nKey Interests: US universities with strong ocean engineering programs and readily available resources for hands-on experience in underwater habitat design and ROV/submersible operation; US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater robotics, exploration, or volcanic environments; opportunities to build, deploy, or operate underwater robots or submersibles, especially near volcanic environments; groups and universities actively involved in underwater habitat design and ROV/submersible operation near underwater volcanoes. Immediate project involvement is paramount.  Identifying and joining relevant US-based groups and universities is a top priority. Specific interest in submersible operation and practical applications of underwater robotics in volcanic exploration and habitat maintenance.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations offering immediate hands-on experience in underwater habitat design, ROV operation, submersible operation, or volcanic exploration; attending relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; connecting with individuals and groups working with underwater robots, submersibles, and undersea habitats near volcanic environments; securing immediate, hands-on project involvement in habitat design or ROV/submersible operation. Joining relevant US-based groups and universities is a top priority.\n\nResearch Priorities: Hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles near volcanic environments; practical applications of underwater robotics in volcanic exploration and habitat maintenance; design and construction of"
