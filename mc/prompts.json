      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Deep-sea exploration and habitat development, focusing on practical skills and logistical aspects.  This involves mastering stainless steel welding and fabrication, analyzing the economic impact of tariffs on relevant materials, and researching ROV technology.  Key biological interests include fish and coral in hydrothermal vent ecosystems near underwater volcanoes.  Current activities center on improving welding skills, completing tariff analysis, and actively networking with Long Beach diving communities and research groups specializing in underwater robotics, volcano research, and deep-sea biology to find collaborative opportunities and relevant affiliations.  Immediate priorities are enhancing welding proficiency, completing the tariff analysis, and securing memberships in relevant Long Beach organizations focused on underwater habitat design and diving."
