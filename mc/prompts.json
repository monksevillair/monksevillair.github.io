      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Hands-on deep-sea habitat development near Long Beach's underwater volcanoes, emphasizing practical skills and project involvement, particularly concerning the construction of large transparent domes for underwater habitats. This involves mastering stainless steel welding, researching ROV technology for deep-sea exploration and construction in volcanic environments, and actively participating in relevant Long Beach communities. Priorities include: improving stainless steel welding proficiency; gaining hands-on ROV experience; joining Long Beach organizations and universities focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics; participating in Long Beach diving events and seasteading groups; and researching the biological impact of deep-sea construction on fish and coral ecosystems, including the logistical challenges of such projects.  Emphasis is on practical, hands-on experience in stainless steel welding and ROV operation, understanding the logistical aspects of deep-sea habitat projects, and researching the design and manufacturing of large transparent domes for submarines and underwater habitats. Immediate focus is on acquiring welding skills, researching ROV technology, connecting with relevant Long Beach organizations and seasteading communities, and investigating the feasibility of incorporating large transparent domes into deep-sea habitat designs."
