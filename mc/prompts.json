      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Gaining immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, and underwater robots (ROVs) and submersibles in the US, prioritizing access through identified US-based groups and universities.  Emphasis is on practical application and direct engagement via participation in relevant events and programs.  The focus is sharply on connecting with active projects and securing training opportunities.\n\nKey Interests:  US universities and organizations with active programs in underwater volcano research, undersea habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology;  specific US-based meetups and scuba events offering networking and hands-on opportunities related to underwater robotics and habitats; identifying and directly connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design and ROV/submersible operation; locating and accessing resources (courses, workshops, internships) at US universities with strong ocean engineering programs relevant to underwater volcanology and submersible technology.  Immediate, hands-on participation is paramount.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and applying to relevant US university programs offering hands-on experience in underwater robotics, habitat design, or volcanology; directly contacting US-based organizations conducting research in these areas to explore opportunities; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups to network and build connections; actively seeking mentorship and collaboration opportunities with experts in underwater robotics, habitat design, and volcanology.\n\nResearch Priorities: ROV and submersible applications in deep-sea volcanic environments; the design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; practical submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations offering hands-on opportunities in underwater robotics, habitat design, and volcanology.  Focus remains on practical training and experience related to underwater"
