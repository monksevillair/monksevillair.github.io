      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Deep-sea habitat development near Long Beach's underwater volcanoes, emphasizing practical application within active seasteading communities.  This involves mastering stainless steel welding, analyzing the economic effects of tariffs on relevant materials, and researching ROV technology for deep-sea exploration and construction in volcanic environments.  Research will prioritize the logistical challenges and economic models for seasteading, focusing on the intersection of stainless steel welding, tariff analysis, ROV applications, fish biology, and coral reef ecosystems. Activities will center on improving welding proficiency, completing tariff analysis, and actively networking within Long Beach's diving communities and research groups specializing in underwater robotics, volcano research, and deep-sea biology, including relevant universities. Immediate priorities include enhancing welding skills, finalizing tariff analysis, identifying and joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics, finding and participating in interesting diving events and active seasteading groups in the Long Beach area, and sourcing stainless steel for deep-sea habitat construction.  Emphasis is on practical application and hands-on experience in stainless steel welding, ROV operation, and the logistical and economic aspects of deep-sea construction, considering the biological impact of deep-sea construction on fish biology and coral ecosystems."
