      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Securing immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, submersibles, and ROVs in the US, prioritizing university and organizational involvement.\n\nKey Interests: US universities and organizations with ocean engineering programs and active projects related to underwater habitat design, submersible operation, and underwater volcanology; US-based meetups and scuba events related to underwater robotics, habitats, and volcanology; connecting with individuals and groups actively involved in these fields, particularly those offering direct project participation.  Emphasis on finding opportunities for hands-on involvement in the design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats and submersibles, and the application of ROVs in deep-sea volcanic environments.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations with relevant programs and active projects; attending relevant diving/scuba events and technical meetups; proactively connecting with groups focused on underwater habitat design, submersible operation, and ROV deployment in volcanic environments; securing immediate hands-on project involvement opportunities.\n\nResearch Priorities: Hands-on submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; practical applications of ROVs in deep-sea volcanic environments; design, construction, and operation of undersea habitats; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities and organizations offering immediate, hands-on participation.  Focus on readily accessible avenues for direct project involvement."
