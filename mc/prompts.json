      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs, and submersibles; prioritizing immediate practical application and focused networking.\n\nKey Interests: Identifying and joining groups and universities specializing in underwater habitat design, ROV technologies, submersible operation, and ocean engineering; discovering and attending relevant meetups and scuba events across the US offering practical experience; researching universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources related to underwater volcanology and submersible technology.  Emphasis on direct engagement and practical skill development.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Researching and applying to universities offering hands-on experience with ROVs, submersibles, and underwater habitat design within ocean engineering programs; actively seeking out and joining organizations focused on underwater volcano research and ROV/submersible technologies; attending local and national diving/scuba events and relevant technical meetups for networking and securing practical experience.\n\nResearch Priorities: ROV and submersible applications in deep-sea volcanic environments; design and construction of underwater habitats; practical aspects of submersible and ROV operation and maintenance; identifying and accessing relevant university resources and hands-on opportunities.  Focus remains on immediate, practical application of knowledge and skill acquisition.\n\nFurther Exploration: Locating and attending relevant diving, technical, and academic events across the US; actively seeking hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles through university programs, organizational affiliations, and volunteer opportunities.  The focus remains on securing immediate, practical experience and collaborative opportunities in underwater volcano research, undersea habitation, ROV, and submersible technology. Economic and governmental considerations are secondary."
