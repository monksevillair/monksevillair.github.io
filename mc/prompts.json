      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate engagement with US-based underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles), prioritizing hands-on experience and community involvement.  Key Interests: Identifying and connecting with US-based universities and groups actively involved in underwater volcano research, habitat design, and submersible technology; locating and participating in relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; researching universities offering programs and resources related to underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, and underwater robotics; securing opportunities for practical experience in ROV/submersible operation and maintenance.  Priority is on finding and joining groups and universities actively working on underwater volcano research, habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology, focusing on universities with strong ocean engineering programs relevant to underwater volcanology and habitat design.  Immediate project participation is paramount.  Focus is on actively building connections with relevant groups and universities, and securing hands-on experience.  Specific emphasis on discovering and joining relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events.  Research will center on finding specific universities and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design."
