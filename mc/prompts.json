      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Hands-on deep-sea habitat development near Long Beach's underwater volcanoes, prioritizing practical skills and project involvement within active seasteading communities. This involves mastering stainless steel welding, researching ROV technology for deep-sea exploration and construction in volcanic environments, and participating in relevant Long Beach activities. Priorities include: improving stainless steel welding proficiency; hands-on experience with ROVs; joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics; and participating in interesting diving events and active seasteading groups in the Long Beach area.  Research will center on the biological impact of deep-sea construction on fish and coral ecosystems and the logistical challenges of deep-sea construction projects. Specific areas of focus include: fish and coral biology; the logistics of deep-sea construction; and identification and engagement with relevant Long Beach organizations and active seasteading groups. Emphasis is on practical, hands-on experience in stainless steel welding and ROV operation, and understanding the logistical aspects of deep-sea construction. Immediate focus will be on acquiring welding skills, researching ROV technology, and identifying and connecting with relevant Long Beach organizations and active seasteading communities."
