      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus:  Gaining immediate hands-on experience with underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, underwater robots (ROVs and submersibles), and related projects at US universities and organizations. Priority is direct project participation, especially in habitat design and ROV operation. Focus is on identifying and joining relevant groups and universities offering immediate involvement.\n\nKey Interests: US universities with strong ocean engineering programs and resources offering hands-on opportunities in underwater habitat design and ROV operation; US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater robotics, exploration, or volcanic environments; opportunities to build, deploy, or operate underwater robots or submersibles, particularly near volcanic environments; groups and universities actively involved in underwater habitat design and ROV operation near underwater volcanoes.  Immediate project involvement is paramount.  Specific interest in finding and joining relevant groups and universities is a top priority.\n\nImmediate Priorities: Identifying and contacting US universities and organizations offering immediate hands-on experience in underwater habitat design, ROV operation, submersible operation, or volcanic exploration; attending relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events; connecting with individuals and groups working with underwater robots, submersibles, and undersea habitats near volcanic environments; securing immediate, hands-on project involvement in habitat design or ROV operation.  Joining relevant groups and universities is a top priority.\n\nResearch Priorities: Hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles near volcanic environments; practical applications of underwater robotics in volcanic exploration and habitat maintenance; design and construction of undersea habitats; identifying key personnel and active research projects at US universities offering immediate, hands-on participation in habitat design, ROV operation, or related projects; information about specific universities and groups actively involved in underwater habitat design, ROV operation"
