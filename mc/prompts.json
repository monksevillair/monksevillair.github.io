      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immersing myself in the world of underwater exploration, specifically focusing on hands-on involvement with US-based projects.  Priority is identifying and joining relevant university or industry groups actively working in these areas. Key Interests: Locating and connecting with US universities boasting strong ocean engineering programs and research groups specializing in underwater volcanology, habitat design, and submersible technology; discovering and participating in US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater exploration; researching and applying to universities offering relevant ocean engineering programs. Goal: Secure immediate, hands-on experience in active US-based projects related to underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, and ROV/submersible technology within university or industry settings.  Finding and joining active project teams is paramount. Current search focus: US universities with strong ocean engineering programs offering research opportunities in underwater volcanology, habitat design, and submersible technology; US-based meetups and scuba diving events focused on underwater exploration; identifying specific research projects and teams working on underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitats, and ROV/submersible technologies.  Emphasis on readily accessible opportunities for immediate, hands-on participation."
