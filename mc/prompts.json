      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current focus: Deep-sea exploration and habitat development, emphasizing practical skills and logistical considerations related to underwater volcano ecosystems.  This involves mastering stainless steel welding techniques, analyzing the economic impact of tariffs on relevant materials, and researching ROV technology for application in these environments.  Biological focus is on fish and coral. Activities prioritize improving welding proficiency, completing tariff analysis, and networking with Long Beach diving communities and research groups specializing in underwater robotics, volcano research, and deep-sea biology.  Immediate priorities include enhancing welding skills, finalizing tariff analysis, and securing memberships in relevant Long Beach diving and underwater habitat development organizations. Specific search focus includes identifying and participating in interesting diving events and connecting with Long Beach groups focused on undersea habitation and underwater robotics.  Research will center on the intersection of stainless steel welding, tariff impacts on deep-sea habitat construction, and ROV application in underwater volcanic environments."
