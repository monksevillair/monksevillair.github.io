      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate involvement in US-based underwater exploration projects, specifically focusing on undersea habitation, underwater robotics (including ROVs and submersibles), and underwater volcanology.  Key Interests: Identifying and connecting with US universities offering strong ocean engineering programs and resources relevant to underwater volcanology, undersea habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology; discovering and participating in US-based meetups and scuba diving events related to underwater exploration; researching and applying to relevant ocean engineering programs and actively seeking out project teams focused on underwater habitat design, ROV/submersible technology, underwater robotics, and underwater volcano exploration. Goal: Secure hands-on experience in university or industry settings, participating in active projects related to underwater volcanoes, undersea habitats, ROVs/submersibles, and underwater robotics.  Finding and joining active project teams focused on underwater habitat design and underwater robotics, with a specific interest in underwater volcanology, is paramount. Current search focus: US universities with ocean engineering programs featuring research in underwater volcanology, undersea habitat design, and ROV/submersible technology; US-based meetups and scuba diving events focused on underwater exploration; specific research projects and teams working on underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitats, and ROV/submersible technologies; opportunities for immediate, hands-on participation in active projects and collaborative groups related to underwater robots and habitat design, with a particular focus on projects involving underwater volcanoes. Emphasis on readily accessible projects and collaborative learning environments related to underwater habitat design, underwater robotics, and underwater volcanology."
