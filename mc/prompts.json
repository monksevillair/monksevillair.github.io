      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Hands-on participation in Long Beach-based projects related to underwater habitat development, specifically the design and manufacturing of large transparent stainless steel domes for submersibles.  Key interests: welding stainless steel, underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, fish and coral biology, ROV technology and operation, and the logistical challenges of deep-sea construction.  This involves identifying and joining relevant Long Beach organizations and universities, participating in local diving events and groups focused on underwater habitats, and actively pursuing practical experience in stainless steel welding and fabrication.  Research priorities are ROV applications in deep-sea volcanic environments and relevant fish and coral species. The goal is to locate and attend trade shows demonstrating submarine and underwater technology, and connect with Long Beach-based groups and universities for opportunities in underwater habitat design and construction, focusing on welding, stainless steel fabrication, and the unique challenges of deep-sea volcanic environments. Economic and governmental considerations are secondary; the priority is direct, practical involvement in the technical aspects of underwater habitat projects.  Immediate priorities are gaining practical welding skills, researching deep-sea volcanic environments, and connecting with Long Beach-based organizations involved in underwater robotics and habitat construction.  Specific focus is on the practical application of welding and stainless steel fabrication to create large transparent domes for submersibles and underwater habitats. This focus prioritizes hands-on learning and practical experience in welding, stainless steel fabrication, and ROV operation within the context of Long Beach-based underwater habitat projects."
