      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Securing hands-on experience in underwater habitat design and ROV operation, specifically within the context of deep-sea volcanic environments.  Key Interests:  Finding and joining relevant groups and universities focused on underwater volcano research, undersea habitat design, underwater robots/ROVs, and submersible technology. Immediate Priorities: Identifying and applying to universities with strong ocean engineering programs and related research opportunities; actively seeking out and joining relevant organizations offering experience in underwater habitat design and ROV operation; and participating in local and national diving/scuba events to network and gain practical experience. Research Priorities: ROV applications in deep-sea volcanic environments; design and construction of underwater habitats; practical aspects of submersible operation. Further Exploration: Attending relevant diving and technical events across the US to network and discover opportunities; actively seeking hands-on experience with ROVs and submersibles through university programs, organizational affiliations, and volunteer opportunities.  The focus is on securing practical, hands-on experience and collaborative opportunities.  Economic and governmental considerations are secondary."
