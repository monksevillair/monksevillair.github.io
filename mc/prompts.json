      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current Focus: Immediate engagement with US-based underwater volcano exploration, undersea habitation, and underwater robotics (ROVs and submersibles), prioritizing hands-on experience and community involvement. Key Interests: Identifying and connecting with US-based universities and groups offering relevant ocean engineering programs and resources related to underwater volcano exploration, ROV/submersible operation, and undersea habitat design. Locating and participating in relevant US-based meetups and scuba diving events.  Emphasis on securing immediate project participation and gaining practical experience within active communities.  Specific areas of interest include:  locating relevant groups/universities actively involved in underwater volcano research and habitat design; gaining practical experience in submersible technology and operation; attending relevant meetups and scuba diving events; researching universities with strong ocean engineering programs specializing in underwater volcanology and habitat design; and learning about advanced undersea habitation technologies.  Finding opportunities for immediate project involvement is paramount."
