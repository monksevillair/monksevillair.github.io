This directly addresses a critical challenge for undersea habitats like the Neptune Station concept \u2013 reliable, sustainable power sources.  The limitations mentioned highlight the need for further innovation, but the potential for high-performance SWBs is huge for long-term, off-grid underwater operations.",
