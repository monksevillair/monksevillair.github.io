        "text": "Interesting early conceptualization of a hyperbaric habitat, though the lack of specifics on materials is a significant limitation.  The community/university collaboration model is noteworthy, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of such projects \u2013 something crucial for building a future underwater city.  It'd be great to see updated plans with a focus on material science advancements since this was published.",
