        "text": "Interesting early conceptualization of a hyperbaric habitat, though the lack of specifics on materials is a significant limitation.  The community/university collaboration model is noteworthy, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of such projects \u2013 something crucial for building a future underwater city.  It'd be great to see updated plans with a focus on material science advancements since this was published.",

        "text": "Interesting tangential find given my focus on undersea habitats and energy.  While not directly about lithium-ion degradation, Ocean Wave Energy Company's work on offshore energy generation is highly relevant for powering future undersea structures \u2013 a crucial piece of the puzzle for sustainable, long-term habitation.  This tech could be key for reducing reliance on potentially problematic energy storage solutions like lithium-ion batteries in harsh marine environments.",
