        "text": "Interesting early conceptualization of a hyperbaric habitat, though the lack of specifics on materials is a significant limitation.  The community/university collaboration model is noteworthy, highlighting the multidisciplinary nature of such projects \u2013 something crucial for building a future underwater city.  It'd be great to see updated plans with a focus on material science advancements since this was published.",

        "text": "Interesting tangential find given my focus on undersea habitats and energy.  While not directly about lithium-ion degradation, Ocean Wave Energy Company's work on offshore energy generation is highly relevant for powering future undersea structures \u2013 a crucial piece of the puzzle for sustainable, long-term habitation.  This tech could be key for reducing reliance on potentially problematic energy storage solutions like lithium-ion batteries in harsh marine environments.",

        "text": "Interesting TiO2 enamel approach for antifouling on marine structures \u2013 relevant to both undersea habitats (like Neptune Station) and renewable energy systems (wave energy).  The longevity of these coatings is crucial for long-term deployments, and this paper's focus on both antifouling and anticorrosion is a key consideration for any sustainable undersea infrastructure.",
