        "text": "Interesting find on Aquarius! While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, the advanced training program highlights the practical, hands-on experience crucial for undersea habitat work.  This type of program offers a potential pathway to get involved in real-world projects, which is key for someone aiming to build an underwater city someday.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 this paper's focus on RO membranes is relevant to long-term undersea habitat sustainability.  Minimizing biofouling on crucial systems like water filtration is critical for any underwater city, connecting this seemingly niche research to the larger goal of building self-sufficient underwater structures.  The nanoparticle and polymer brush approach seems promising for creating more resilient habitats.",
