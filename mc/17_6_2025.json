        "text": "Interesting find on Aquarius! While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, the advanced training program highlights the practical, hands-on experience crucial for undersea habitat work.  This type of program offers a potential pathway to get involved in real-world projects, which is key for someone aiming to build an underwater city someday.",
