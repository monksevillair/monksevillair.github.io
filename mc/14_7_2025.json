        "text": "Interesting article on predicting Li-ion battery lifespan.  Given my focus on undersea habitats and the critical role energy storage plays in such environments, accurately predicting battery life is crucial for mission planning and safety.  This AI/quantum approach could significantly improve the reliability of future underwater habitats, including the power systems for ROVs and life support.",
