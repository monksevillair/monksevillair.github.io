        "text": "Interesting article on biofouling in floating wind farms.  While not directly related to underwater volcanoes or habitats, the biofouling challenge is universal in subsea structures and directly impacts the longevity and efficiency of any underwater installation, including those crucial for undersea energy generation and habitat design.  This highlights the need for robust, long-term solutions across the board.",
