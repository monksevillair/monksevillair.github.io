        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013  while JFD's welding work focuses on large-scale undersea construction, this paper tackles a crucial, smaller-scale challenge for any long-term underwater habitat: maintaining clean, efficient membranes for water processing.  Minimizing biofouling is key for sustainable life support systems, something critical for both undersea volcanoes and habitats.",
