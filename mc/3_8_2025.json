        "text": "Neat to see JFD pushing the boundaries of hyperbaric welding.  This is directly relevant to building and maintaining underwater habitats and infrastructure \u2013 crucial for my long-term underwater city goal, and a practical application of the skills I'm seeking to develop.  The Aberdeen facility's capabilities are impressive, and it's great to see real-world progress in this niche area.",

While seemingly unrelated to biofouling at first glance, the challenges of maintaining long-term ocean observatories like the one mentioned directly relate to biofouling mitigation \u2013 crucial for the success of any sustained undersea habitat or infrastructure project, including those near volcanically active areas.",
