This is directly relevant to building and maintaining underwater habitats and infrastructure \u2013 crucial for my long-term underwater city goal, and a practical application of the skills I'm seeking to develop.  The Aberdeen facility's capabilities are impressive, and it's great to see real-world progress in this niche area.",
