        "text": "This video showcases an innovative application of 3D printing technology in marine environments, directly relevant to underwater construction and ecosystem integration. The concept of using 3D printed structures to protect coastlines while supporting marine life could be adapted for larger-scale underwater habitats, potentially addressing challenges in seasteading and subsea city development. It's a practical example of how advanced manufacturing techniques can be applied to create multifunctional underwater structures.",
