        "text": "This technical paper from DTIC presents a novel approach to modeling complex wave interactions with submerged vehicles, crucial for underwater habitat design and subsea construction. The method combines high-order spectral analysis with boundary integral equations, potentially improving our ability to simulate and predict the behavior of structures in dynamic underwater environments \u2013 a key challenge in developing sustainable underwater cities.",
