        "text": "This digitized index from 1978 could be a goldmine for underwater city enthusiasts. It likely contains early research on coastal engineering and marine structures, which are crucial for seasteading and subsea habitat development. The historical perspective might reveal forgotten techniques or inspire new approaches to underwater construction challenges.",
