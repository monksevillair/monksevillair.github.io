While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, the advanced training program at FIU's Aquarius habitat is highly relevant for hands-on experience with undersea living and the operational realities of a hyperbaric environment \u2013 crucial for my underwater city aspirations.",

        "text": "While not directly about ROVs, this self-calibrating pH sensor is a crucial component for long-term underwater monitoring, essential for understanding the environments where ROVs operate and habitats are built.  Accurate, low-maintenance sensors like this are key to enabling the kind of sustained data collection needed for projects involving underwater volcanoes and habitats.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 focusing on RO membranes is relevant to long-term undersea habitats.  Maintaining clean surfaces on things like habitat life support systems is crucial; this paper's nanoparticle/polymer approach could be a game changer for minimizing maintenance in those harsh environments.  Definitely relevant to the Aquarius habitat training discussion from earlier.",
