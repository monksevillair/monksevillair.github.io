        "text": "While not directly about ROVs, this self-calibrating pH sensor is a crucial component for long-term underwater monitoring, essential for understanding the environments where ROVs operate and habitats are built.  Accurate, low-maintenance sensors like this are key to enabling the kind of sustained data collection needed for projects involving underwater volcanoes and habitats.",

Maintaining clean surfaces on things like habitat life support systems is crucial; this paper's nanoparticle/polymer approach could be a game changer for minimizing maintenance in those harsh environments.  Definitely relevant to the Aquarius habitat training discussion from earlier.",
