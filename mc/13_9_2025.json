        "text": "Interesting historical perspective on hyperbaric habitats, albeit land-based.  While not directly related to underwater volcanoes, the USC Catalina chamber's design and operational history offer valuable insights into the challenges of creating and maintaining pressurized environments \u2013 crucial for future undersea habitats.  A good starting point for understanding the engineering and life support complexities involved.",
