        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real-world habitat is invaluable, offering practical insights beyond theoretical research.  This is exactly the kind of practical experience I'm looking for to bridge the gap between theory and practice in my underwater city ambitions.",
