Hands-on experience in a real-world habitat is invaluable, offering practical insights beyond theoretical research.  This is exactly the kind of practical experience I'm looking for to bridge the gap between theory and practice in my underwater city ambitions.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on geothermal \u2013 tapping magma directly is a huge leap from traditional methods.  This could be a game changer for powering future undersea habitats, especially those near volcanically active zones, and significantly reduce reliance on surface-based power sources.  Direct magma energy extraction could be a key enabler for the large-scale underwater cities I'm interested in.",
