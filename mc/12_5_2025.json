        "text": "This video provides a solid overview of underwater construction methods, particularly relevant for those interested in subsea habitats. While it doesn't delve into advanced topics like ROV-assisted welding or transparent dome manufacturing, it offers a good foundation for understanding the challenges of building in aquatic environments. The segment on cofferdam construction could be especially useful for small-scale underwater city prototypes.",
