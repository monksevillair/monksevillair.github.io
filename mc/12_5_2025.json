The article's mention of both surface and submerged settlements highlights the diverse approaches to ocean colonization, connecting with my interest in transparent domes for submersibles and the broader goal of creating an underwater city.  It's a good starting point for understanding the legal and logistical hurdles involved, even if it lacks the technical detail I'm seeking.",
