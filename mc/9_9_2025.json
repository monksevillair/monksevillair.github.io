The challenges highlighted, especially with wet welding, are crucial for any large-scale underwater construction project, like, say, an underwater city.  This points to a key materials science and engineering hurdle we'll need to overcome.",

        "text": "Interesting article on biofouling in floating wind farms \u2013 relevant because fouling is a huge problem for any long-term underwater structure, including my eventual underwater city.  While focused on wind farms, the mitigation strategies discussed here are directly applicable to undersea habitats and could inform the design of more robust, self-cleaning systems.",
