        "text": "Interesting article on underwater welding \u2013 directly relevant to building and maintaining undersea habitats.  The challenges highlighted, especially with wet welding, are crucial for any large-scale underwater construction project, like, say, an underwater city.  This points to a key materials science and engineering hurdle we'll need to overcome.",
