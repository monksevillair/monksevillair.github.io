        "text": "This DEEP habitat concept is intriguing, especially given my focus on undersea habitats and volcano exploration.  The modular design and public access angle are interesting departures from typical research-only setups, hinting at a future where such environments are more accessible.  It'll be fascinating to see how their plans for integration with submersibles and research labs pan out.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013  directly applicable to long-term undersea habitat viability.  While DEEP's modular habitat is exciting, this paper tackles a crucial, often-overlooked challenge: keeping those habitats clean and functional for extended periods.  Nanoparticles and polymer brushes for RO membrane protection could be adapted for other surfaces in underwater environments.",
