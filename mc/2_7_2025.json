        "text": "This DEEP habitat concept is intriguing, especially given my focus on undersea habitats and volcano exploration.  The modular design and public access angle are interesting departures from typical research-only setups, hinting at a future where such environments are more accessible.  It'll be fascinating to see how their plans for integration with submersibles and research labs pan out.",
