        "text": "Interesting application of tomography for detecting rock weaknesses in underwater tunnel construction \u2013 directly relevant to seismic considerations for large-scale underwater infrastructure like the Japan-Korea Tunnel.  This kind of precise geological surveying is crucial for mitigating risks and ensuring the long-term stability of any underwater city project.",
