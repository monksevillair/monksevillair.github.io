        "text": "Solid overview of stainless steel grades for subsea applications, relevant to my current focus on underwater volcano welding.  The mention of Sanicro 35 as a cost-competitive option is particularly interesting given the logistical and economic challenges I'm researching.  Definitely helps inform material selection for future deep-sea projects.",

Directly addresses the material science aspect of my subsea welding research, especially the cost-competitiveness of Sanicro 35 which is crucial for feasibility.  This is exactly the kind of practical, materials-focused info needed for underwater construction projects.",
