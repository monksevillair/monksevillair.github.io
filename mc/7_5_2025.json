        "text": "Interesting paper on carbon steel/stainless steel welds, though it seems focused on shipbuilding rather than underwater volcano exploration.  The heat source effects on weld structure could still be relevant to my underwater welding project, especially considering the unique challenges of high-pressure environments.  Might be worth looking into how these findings translate to stainless steel welds under extreme conditions.",
