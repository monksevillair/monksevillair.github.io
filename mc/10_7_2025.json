While the Neptune Station article is dated, it showcases a compelling vision of community-university collaboration in undersea research\u2014relevant to both building underwater habitats and the multidisciplinary approach I'm interested in.  The focus on community involvement hints at the broader societal implications of future undersea cities.",

This article's concise explanation of the chemical reaction is a useful primer for anyone tackling the complexities of undersea base design.",
