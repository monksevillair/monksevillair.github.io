While the Neptune Station article is dated, it showcases a compelling vision of community-university collaboration in undersea research\u2014relevant to both building underwater habitats and the multidisciplinary approach I'm interested in.  The focus on community involvement hints at the broader societal implications of future undersea cities.",

The link to autonomous vehicles is also key for the kind of hands-on ROV work I'm pursuing, tying in nicely with the Neptune Station and life support system discussions from earlier.",
