        "text": "Interesting TiO2 enamel approach for antifouling on marine structures \u2013 relevant to undersea habitats and energy generation. While JFD's hyperbaric welding is crucial for construction, this paper addresses the long-term maintenance challenge of biofouling, which is critical for the longevity of any underwater installation.  The impact factor is modest, but the topic is directly relevant to my underwater city goals.",
