        "text": "This project showcases an innovative intersection of 3D printing technology, marine ecosystem preservation, and coastal engineering. It's particularly relevant to underwater habitat design, demonstrating how we can create structures that not only protect against rising sea levels but also support marine life. The use of advanced materials and printing techniques for large-scale marine applications could be invaluable for future underwater city projects.",
