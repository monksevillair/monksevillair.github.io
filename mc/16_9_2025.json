        "text": "Interesting tangent on hyperbaric welding \u2013 while not directly about habitat *materials*, the challenges of welding at depth are directly relevant to constructing and maintaining underwater structures.  This points to the crucial intersection of materials science and specialized construction techniques needed for undersea habitats, especially considering the harsh conditions near underwater volcanoes.",

While not directly related to underwater volcanoes or habitats, the biofouling challenge highlights a crucial design consideration for any long-term underwater structure, including my eventual underwater city.  The mitigation strategies discussed are directly applicable to the longevity and maintenance of subsea infrastructure.",
