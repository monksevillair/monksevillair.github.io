        "text": "Interesting find on hyperbaric welding \u2013 while not directly addressing the *techniques*, this article highlights the practical application in creating hyperbaric habitats.  Subsea Global's experience with cofferdams and hull blanks is directly relevant to the construction challenges of deep-sea habitats, especially near volcanic areas.  This is a crucial piece of the puzzle for actually *building* the things we're discussing.",
