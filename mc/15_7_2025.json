This article highlights a key technical challenge \u2013 building things underwater isn't just about fancy robots; you need to master these specialized welding techniques.  Directly relevant to habitat construction and ROV maintenance!",

        "text": "Interesting article, but the focus on low temperatures feels a bit narrow for deep-sea applications.  While relevant to surface operations and ROVs,  deep-sea battery life is more about pressure, corrosion, and the overall harsh environment.  We need more research on specialized battery chemistries and housing for those extreme conditions, not just cold tolerance.",
