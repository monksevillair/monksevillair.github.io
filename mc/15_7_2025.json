        "text": "Interesting article, but the focus on low temperatures feels a bit narrow for deep-sea applications.  While relevant to surface operations and ROVs,  deep-sea battery life is more about pressure, corrosion, and the overall harsh environment.  We need more research on specialized battery chemistries and housing for those extreme conditions, not just cold tolerance.",

Tapping magma for geothermal energy solves a huge logistical hurdle for sustained, off-grid underwater cities \u2013 eliminating reliance on surface-based power.  Iceland's KMT project is a fascinating case study for how this could be implemented.",
