While dated, this Neptune Station project showcases a community-university collaboration model for undersea research that's surprisingly relevant to modern undersea habitat design.  The focus on modularity and community involvement hints at the potential scalability needed for future, larger-scale underwater projects.",

        "text": "Interesting TiO2 enamel approach for antifouling on marine structures \u2013 relevant to both undersea habitats (like Neptune Station) and renewable energy systems needed for those habitats.  This could be a key material science solution for long-term viability of underwater installations, reducing maintenance needs and extending lifespan.",
