        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitats.  Hands-on experience in a real-world undersea environment?  That's way more valuable than any theoretical materials science paper.  Shows commitment and provides practical skills directly applicable to building future underwater cities.",
