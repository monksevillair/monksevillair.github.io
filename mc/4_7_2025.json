        "text": "This modular subsea habitat concept from DEEP is right in line with my interest in undersea habitation and its potential for research and even public access.  The mention of 2027 as a target date suggests a level of seriousness and feasibility that's exciting to see, especially given the focus on modularity for scalability.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on for future developments.",

        "text": "Interesting historical perspective on undersea habitats!  While not about hyperbaric materials specifically, Neptune Station's community-university model offers a fascinating glimpse into early approaches to undersea living, contrasting sharply with DEEP's modular approach mentioned earlier.  It highlights the enduring challenge of integrating human habitation with the marine environment.",
