        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for undersea construction.  The ability to weld reliably at depth is essential for building and maintaining any underwater structure, including habitats and research stations.  Understanding the challenges and techniques involved is key to advancing undersea engineering.",

        "text": "Interesting article on biofouling in floating wind farms \u2013 relevant because the same challenges will need to be addressed in underwater cities.  While not directly related to volcanoes or habitats, mitigating biofouling is critical for long-term infrastructure integrity in any submerged environment, impacting both energy generation and structural stability.",
