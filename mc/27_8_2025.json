        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for building underwater structures.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is paramount for constructing robust and durable undersea habitats, and this piece gives a good overview of the challenges involved.",

        "text": "Interesting find on the seawater battery!  While not directly related to volcano exploration, this tech is super relevant for powering future undersea habitats and ROVs \u2013 less reliance on land-based power sources is key for truly independent operations.  Could be a game changer for long-duration missions and remote locations.",
