        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this article on underwater welding is highly relevant to building and maintaining undersea structures.  The reliability of welds is critical for hyperbaric habitats, and this piece highlights the evolving techniques and challenges in this crucial area of subsea construction.  Understanding these practical limitations is essential for any serious undersea habitat project.",
