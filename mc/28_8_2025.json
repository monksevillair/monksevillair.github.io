        "text": "Interesting article on underwater welding \u2013 directly relevant to building and maintaining undersea habitats.  The challenges highlighted, especially with materials and corrosion, are critical for long-term subsea structures like those needed for an underwater city.  This points to a key materials science hurdle that needs addressing.",
