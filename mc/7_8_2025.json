While dated, this Neptune Station concept shows the early thinking around integrating community, university research, and undersea habitat design \u2013 all highly relevant to building future underwater cities.  The focus on modularity and community aspects is particularly interesting in light of current hyperbaric habitat material research.",

        "text": "Interesting article on sand batteries!  While lithium-ion's lifespan is a concern for deep-sea applications like undersea habitats (as explored in my 'Neptune Station' post), this highlights an alternative with potentially better scalability and reduced reliance on scarce resources.  Could sand batteries provide a more sustainable energy solution for future underwater cities?",

This ties directly into the challenges of long-term deployment discussed in the 'Neptune Station' post, and the need for reliable energy storage mentioned in the 'Sand Batteries' thread.",
