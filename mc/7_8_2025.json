While dated, this Neptune Station concept shows the early thinking around integrating community, university research, and undersea habitat design \u2013 all highly relevant to building future underwater cities.  The focus on modularity and community aspects is particularly interesting in light of current hyperbaric habitat material research.",

        "text": "Interesting article on sand batteries!  While lithium-ion's lifespan is a concern for deep-sea applications like undersea habitats (as explored in my 'Neptune Station' post), this highlights an alternative with potentially better scalability and reduced reliance on scarce resources.  Could sand batteries provide a more sustainable energy solution for future underwater cities?",

        "text": "Interesting thesis on Li-ion battery degradation!  Directly relevant to my interest in undersea habitats and ROVs, where reliable, long-lasting power is critical.  Understanding degradation mechanisms is key to designing robust energy solutions for extended underwater deployments, especially in harsh environments like hydrothermal vents.",
