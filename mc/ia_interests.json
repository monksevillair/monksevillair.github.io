      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Current research focus: Practical challenges in underwater habitat design and construction, with emphasis on welding stainless steel in marine environments, particularly near underwater volcanoes. Exploring the integration of fish biology and coral ecosystems with human-made structures. Investigating underwater robotics and ROVs for construction and maintenance. Seeking information on submersibles, large transparent dome manufacturing for underwater viewing, and saturation diving experiences. Interested in universities offering ocean engineering programs, trade shows showcasing submarine technology, and diving groups in the Long Beach area. Looking for technical papers, project proposals, and case studies related to undersea habitation, with a particular focus on initiatives in California."
