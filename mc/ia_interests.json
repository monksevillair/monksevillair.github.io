      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Investigating the synergy between underwater volcanoes and habitat development, with emphasis on innovative construction techniques for extreme marine environments. Exploring cutting-edge underwater robotics, ROVs, and submersibles for both habitat construction and scientific exploration of volcanic regions. Seeking information on universities offering specialized ocean engineering programs and their research initiatives in underwater habitat design. Identifying diving groups, scuba events, and meetups across the US to network with enthusiasts and professionals in the field. Prioritizing technical papers, project proposals, and case studies on practical underwater habitat projects, including integration with volcanic ecosystems. Exploring opportunities for hands-on experience in underwater technology development through trade shows, university partnerships, and seasteading initiatives, with a focus on geological considerations for long-term underwater city development near volcanic areas."
