      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Exploring the intersection of underwater volcanology, sustainable subsea habitation, and advanced robotics for deep-sea exploration and construction. Seeking technical papers, project proposals, and case studies on underwater habitat design in volcanic marine environments, with emphasis on submersibles and ROVs. Investigating universities offering specialized ocean engineering programs, particularly those with initiatives in underwater habitat development and volcanic studies. Identifying diving groups, scuba events, and meetups across the US to network with enthusiasts and professionals in underwater exploration and construction. Focusing on resources that integrate multiple aspects of underwater city development, from geological considerations of volcanic submarine environments to human habitation challenges, prioritizing the application of cutting-edge robotics for both construction and scientific exploration in these extreme underwater settings."
