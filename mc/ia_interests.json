      "description": "My ultimate goal is to one day build an underwater city, and I am focused on collecting the skills, connecting with people, and understanding the resources necessary to achieve this. I am deeply interested in the multidisciplinary aspects of creating and inhabiting underwater environments. This encompasses robotics for subsea construction and maintenance, the unique challenges of underwater architecture and structural engineering, and innovations in materials science like 3D concrete printing for marine applications. My interests also include the geology of the underwater world, the integration of marine ecosystems (including diverse fish populations) with human-made structures, and the human experience of exploring these environments through scuba diving and freediving. I am keen on learning about seasteading concepts and practical implementations as potential pathways or related endeavors. I'm looking for technical papers, case studies, project proposals, and discussions that contribute to this long-term vision."

      "description": "Investigating the intersection of underwater volcanoes, human habitation, and advanced robotics for sustainable subsea environments. Seeking technical papers, project proposals, and case studies on innovative construction techniques in volcanic marine settings, with emphasis on submersible technologies and ROVs for habitat development. Exploring universities offering specialized ocean engineering programs, particularly those with initiatives in underwater habitat design integrating volcanic ecosystems. Identifying diving groups, scuba events, and meetups across the US to network with enthusiasts and professionals in underwater exploration and construction. Prioritizing resources that combine multiple aspects of underwater city development, from geological considerations to human habitation challenges in volcanic submarine environments, including the application of cutting-edge robotics and submersibles for both construction and scientific exploration."
