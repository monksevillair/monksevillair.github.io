        "text": "This symposium proceedings from 25 years ago offers a fascinating look at the early intersections of biology and AUV technology. It's particularly relevant for those interested in underwater robotics and habitat development, as it likely contains foundational ideas that have shaped current submersible designs and bio-inspired underwater systems.",
