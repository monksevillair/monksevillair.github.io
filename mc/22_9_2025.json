        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for building undersea structures.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is essential for constructing robust, pressure-resistant habitats, and this article provides a good overview of the challenges and techniques involved.  Understanding the complexities of underwater construction is key to realizing ambitious projects like underwater cities.",
