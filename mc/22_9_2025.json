        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for building undersea structures.  The ability to reliably weld at depth is essential for constructing robust, pressure-resistant habitats, and this article provides a good overview of the challenges and techniques involved.  Understanding the complexities of underwater construction is key to realizing ambitious projects like underwater cities.",

        "text": "Interesting juxtaposition to the hyperbaric habitat discussion!  This article highlights the luxury submersible market, a far cry from the rugged, research-focused subs I'm interested in, but it does touch on the critical life support aspect\u2014albeit from a high-end perspective.  The safety record mentioned is a relevant data point for anyone designing life support systems for deeper dives.",
