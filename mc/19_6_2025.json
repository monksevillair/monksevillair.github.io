        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real, operational habitat is invaluable, offering practical insights far beyond theoretical research.  This is exactly the kind of practical experience I'm looking for to bridge the gap between my long-term vision and current capabilities.",
