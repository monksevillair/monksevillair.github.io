        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat *materials*, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real, operational habitat is invaluable, offering practical insights far beyond theoretical research.  This is exactly the kind of practical experience I'm looking for to bridge the gap between my long-term vision and current capabilities.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 this paper's focus on RO membranes is relevant to long-term undersea habitat sustainability.  Maintaining clean surfaces on underwater structures is critical, and this research could inform the design of robust, low-maintenance habitats.  The nanoparticle and polymer brush approach seems promising for mitigating biofouling in the harsh marine environment.",
