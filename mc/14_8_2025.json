        "text": "While not directly about habitat *materials*, this article on hyperbaric welding is crucial for undersea construction.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is vital for building anything substantial underwater, whether it's a habitat or an underwater volcano research station.",

        "text": "Interesting article, especially given my focus on undersea habitats and energy generation.  While this is about exporting geothermal power, it highlights the potential of harnessing undersea energy sources and the engineering challenges of long-distance subsea power transmission \u2013 directly relevant to building self-sustaining underwater cities.",
