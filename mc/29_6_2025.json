The challenges of welding at depth are directly relevant to constructing robust, pressure-resistant habitats, and understanding these techniques is key to any serious undersea construction project.",

        "text": "Interesting angle on biofouling \u2013 focusing on RO membranes is relevant to closed-loop life support systems in undersea habitats, a critical challenge for long-duration missions.  This nanoparticle/polymer brush approach could be a game-changer for maintaining water quality in those environments, unlike the more structural biofouling concerns of hyperbaric habitats discussed earlier.",
