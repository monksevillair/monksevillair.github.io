        "text": "While not directly about hyperbaric habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitats.  Getting hands-on experience in a real-world undersea environment like Aquarius is invaluable, offering practical skills and connections crucial for future projects.  This is less about the materials themselves and more about the operational expertise needed to work with them.",
