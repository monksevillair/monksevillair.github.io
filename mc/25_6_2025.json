Getting hands-on experience in a real-world undersea environment like Aquarius is invaluable, offering practical skills and connections crucial for future projects.  This is less about the materials themselves and more about the operational expertise needed to work with them.",

Maintaining stable aquatic environments is a foundational challenge for both large-scale aquariums and future undersea habitats; the engineering principles overlap significantly.  The focus on water quality highlights a crucial aspect often overlooked in discussions of deep-sea exploration and habitation.",
