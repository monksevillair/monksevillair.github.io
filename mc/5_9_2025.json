        "text": "Predicting Li-ion battery lifespan is crucial for undersea habitats \u2013  a longer lifespan means fewer trips to resupply Hydrolab-style habitats, or more reliable power for ROVs exploring underwater volcanoes.  This AI/quantum approach could be a game-changer for extending mission durations and reducing the logistical headaches of deep-sea operations.",

        "text": "This Ulster University paper on biofouling mitigation is directly relevant to long-term undersea habitat viability.  Preventing biofouling on underwater structures like habitats or energy generators is critical for their longevity and efficiency, a key consideration for any underwater city project.  The study of anti-biofouling strategies, especially in the context of longer-term deployments, is essential for making such projects feasible.",
