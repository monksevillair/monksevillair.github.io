        "text": "Interesting historical piece on Hydrolab!  While insulation specifics aren't detailed, the challenges of long-term undersea habitation highlighted here \u2013 especially concerning human factors \u2013 are directly relevant to modern habitat design and my interest in underwater volcano exploration.  It's a good reminder of the legacy we build upon.",
