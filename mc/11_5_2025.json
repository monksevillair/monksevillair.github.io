        "text": "This video offers a comprehensive overview of underwater construction methods, which is directly relevant to building subsea habitats. It covers cofferdam techniques, caisson technology, and underwater concrete pouring\u2014all crucial for creating stable structures in marine environments. The content aligns well with the challenges of constructing large-scale underwater cities and provides insights into how current engineering practices could be adapted for more ambitious subsea projects.",
