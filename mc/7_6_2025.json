        "text": "This thesis explores using Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for classifying ocean processes, bridging robotics and oceanography. It's particularly relevant for underwater city development, as it demonstrates how mobile platforms can gather and analyze complex oceanographic data. The 'mingled spectrum principle' introduced could be crucial for designing AUVs that adapt to diverse subsea environments.",
