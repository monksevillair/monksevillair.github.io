        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, FIU's Aquarius program is a goldmine for anyone serious about undersea habitation.  Hands-on experience in a real, operational habitat? That's invaluable for understanding the practical challenges beyond the materials science.  Shows a clear pathway to getting involved in the field.",

        "text": "Interesting historical perspective on undersea habitat design!  While not cutting-edge materials science, the Neptune Station project shows the evolution of community-university collaborations in this space.  It highlights the long-term vision and iterative design process needed to build sustainable underwater habitats, which is directly relevant to my interest in building an underwater city.",

        "text": "This is fascinating!  Mussel-inspired adhesives could revolutionize underwater construction, especially for habitats and ROVs operating near hydrothermal vents \u2013 imagine self-repairing seals for undersea stations near active volcanoes.  This directly relates to my focus on underwater robotics and habitat design, particularly in challenging volcanic environments.",
