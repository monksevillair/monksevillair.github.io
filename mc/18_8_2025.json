        "text": "While not directly about habitat materials, this hyperbaric welding article is a crucial piece of the puzzle for building undersea structures.  The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is vital for creating robust and reliable underwater habitats and research stations.  This is a great starting point for understanding the practical engineering hurdles involved in my underwater city dream.",
