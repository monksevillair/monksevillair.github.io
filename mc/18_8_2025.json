The challenges of welding at depth are immense, and understanding these techniques is vital for creating robust and reliable underwater habitats and research stations.  This is a great starting point for understanding the practical engineering hurdles involved in my underwater city dream.",

The long-term implications for closed-loop habitats, particularly in the context of undersea volcanoes, are huge.  It's also a great counterpoint to the ROV biofouling discussion; these biofilms are *the* biofouling challenge we need to address!",
