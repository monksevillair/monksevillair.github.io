        "text": "Neat to see JFD's hyperbaric welding trials from 2017.  This directly relates to building underwater habitats, especially the need for robust, reliable welding techniques in a high-pressure environment.  Shows the kind of specialized expertise and infrastructure required for deep-sea construction projects.",

        "text": "This video offers a rare glimpse into the extreme environment of saturation diving, a critical technique for deep-sea construction and maintenance. The insights into life support systems, pressure management, and long-term underwater habitation are directly applicable to underwater city design. It highlights the human factors and engineering challenges we need to solve for extended subsea living.",
