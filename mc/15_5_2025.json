        "text": "Neat to see JFD's hyperbaric welding trials from 2017.  This directly relates to building underwater habitats, especially the need for robust, reliable welding techniques in a high-pressure environment.  Shows the kind of specialized expertise and infrastructure required for deep-sea construction projects.",

        "text": "This video offers a rare glimpse into the extreme environment of saturation diving, a critical technique for deep-sea construction and maintenance. The insights into life support systems, pressure management, and long-term underwater habitation are directly applicable to underwater city design. It highlights the human factors and engineering challenges we need to solve for extended subsea living.",

        "text": "This paper on 3D-printed marine concrete is right up my alley!  Given my focus on building underwater habitats, the sustainability and potential of this tech for subsea structures is incredibly relevant, especially considering the challenges of traditional construction methods at depth.  It directly supports the long-term vision of an underwater city by offering a potentially more efficient and eco-friendly approach.",
