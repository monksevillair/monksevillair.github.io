Lithium-ion batteries are a game changer for range and power, but reliability in the crushing depths is key; this LiFT battery sounds like a significant step forward for undersea exploration and habitat projects.  The military contract is interesting too \u2013 tech often trickles down.",

While not directly about undersea habitats, the Adeon team's expertise in acoustic data is crucial for understanding the soundscape of underwater environments, which is vital for designing effective communication and navigation systems for undersea habitats and ROVs.  Their work in managing oceanographic data is also relevant for creating accurate models of underwater volcanic activity and its impact on habitat design.",
