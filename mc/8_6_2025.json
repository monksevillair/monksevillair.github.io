        "text": "This proceedings document from MIT's Sea Grant College Program is a goldmine for anyone interested in underwater construction and habitation. It covers automation in marine system design, which is crucial for developing efficient and safe underwater structures. The focus on large systems and manufacturing automation aligns well with the challenges of building underwater cities, offering insights that are still relevant to modern subsea engineering and robotics applications.",
