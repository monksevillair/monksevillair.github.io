        "text": "This lecture by Prof. Wang on Very Large Floating Structure (VLFS) technology is highly relevant to underwater city development. It explores innovative engineering solutions for creating habitable spaces on water, which could be adapted for subsea environments. The discussion on structural design, wave interaction, and modular construction provides valuable insights for large-scale underwater habitats near volcanic regions.",
