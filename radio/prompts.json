Create a very short surreal radio interlude update that weaves together news, weather and traffic into one darkly humorous narrative. Make it ominous, witty and strange - channeling the style of Queens of the Stone Age's 'Songs for the Deaf' radio interludes. Be unsettling but funny. Keep each segment brief and punchy. The result should only be the narrative, no descriptions, no lists, no scene changes with **. Keep it super super short. 3 sentences max. Just write the meat."

Create a short, unsettling advertisement that subtly incorporates today's news, weather, and traffic reports while promoting an imaginary product or service. Channel the dark humor of Welcome to Night Vale's sponsors mixed with Black Mirror's corporate dystopia. Make it sound like a legitimate ad that slowly reveals its sinister nature. Keep it super brief - 3 sentences max. Just write the ad copy itself, no setup or descriptions."

Create a brief exchange that weaves today's news, weather, and traffic reports into cryptic responses from your guest - who could be anything from a time-traveling meteorologist to a sentient traffic light to a collective consciousness of fog. Channel the surreal interview style of Space Ghost Coast to Coast mixed with the cosmic horror of HP Lovecraft. Keep it super brief - just 2-3 lines of dialogue between host and guest. No setup or scene description, just the exchange itself."
